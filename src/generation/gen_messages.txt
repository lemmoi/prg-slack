houghb: Also please add photos and update your profile with your name so that when we post in the python channel the Beck group members know who is posting
luizoliveira: luizoliveira has joined the channel
houghb: A few other tips:
- Eventually we may have many channels - you do not need to join every channel if you don’t want to (if you are in more channels you will get more notifications).  You join channels by looking at them the first time; you can leave them by clicking the down arrow next to the channel’s name once you’re reading it.
- As far as I can tell, only channels that you’ve joined show up in the pane on the left (your channels list).  If you want to see all the other available channels to join click the + sign next to the channels list.
- You can customize what notifications you receive and how using that same down arrow for each channel individually, or globally by clicking the down arrow by the UWPRG team name.
- There are both desktop and mobile apps for slack, so you don’t need to log in via the webpage every time you want to check it
- By default you will not be notified about new messages unless the slack app is open - if you would like to get an e-mail when someone mentions you (using @yourname) or you get a new private message, you can configure that here 
luizoliveira: My French collaborators use a GUI for git, called gitk
arushi: I liked Wes’s idea for error_logs
luizoliveira: there is almost no documentation and I guess that  just few people know about it.
luizoliveira: but it is awesome
luizoliveira: I found some info today
luizoliveira: <missing_message>
luizoliveira: you can have a look on a real example  (a paper we’re finishing):
houghb: arushi: there is an error_logs channel per wes’ suggestion - to join click the + sign next to channels then click the channel you want to join
houghb: luizoliveira: am I correct in my sense that gitk is a GUI wrapper for git, but otherwise does all the same things that we can do from the git command line (it just displays them in an easier to read way)?
luizoliveira: houghb, I think you are right.  But for me as a beginner was super helpful. I always try to don't use GUI whenever is possible. But, for example, to see the commits history is really great.
luizoliveira: but the guy on the link I’ve sent you seems to think differently. He says: “ it actually does really useful things that just cannot be done in a CLI."
houghb: I got turned on to a good podcast from the Beck slack group, check it out if you need some interesting listening: 
luizoliveira: I didn’t start to hear yet. But just loved the minimalist website.
pfaendtner: not counting undergraduates, how many open desks are available downstairs? There are two upstairs
houghb: Two.  Kovas has a desk and there is one that isn’t used by anyone
houghb: But a grad student would be sad to sit at the unoccupied desk...

luizoliveira: for the last 4 years or so, I use to have a look on his lists
luizoliveira: it’s crazy. there was a year he read like 100 books!!!
wesleybeckner: ooo Chrisfumaster is tkinter what your using for your MetaD GUI?
wesleybeckner: chrisfu: gotta get used to the tags
arushi: Found Jim here

houghb: Does this kick off a search of the internet for obscure references to Jim? :simple_smile:
arushi: Ofcourse
houghb: “Women, listen up”

pfaendtner: “PRGs, get to work” :wink:
pfaendtner: wonder if anyone can find the teletubby jim
houghb: I really wanted to make the teletubby part of the github page and spent too long searching for it a couple weeks ago…  Even checked with Vance…  it has disappeared
pfaendtner: only patrick has it. you will have to go to florida to get it
houghb: That is a challenge to all the new group members who haven’t seen this photo
houghb: I finally understand why Pat never talks to us anymore… Jim silenced him to get rid of the photo
arushi: haha

wesleybeckner: sometimes my jobs sit in q for up to 12 hours, even though we have nodes available. does anyone else have this come up?
wesleybeckner: update: has to do with the size of the job. my .pbs asks for 144 cores; ppn agnostic. it sits in q for a long time. another job with 48 cores ppn agnostic gets put up immediately (even though we have 24 8-core nodes available)
arushi: Schedulers usually check for time and cores used and give priorities for jobs 
arushi: Try using smaller runtime
wesleybeckner: arushi
wesleybeckner: you right
pfaendtner: blake I just endorsed the hell out of you on LinkedIn. Hope you feel the glow
houghb: Thanks for the endorsements everyone!
pfaendtner: one skill you could add that is not there is “being awesome” - I would def endorse that right away

arushi: And.... The Onion for Chemical Engineering related news 
wesleybeckner: The rise of computational chemistry in the early 2000's allowed unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations to be applied to predictive models of impact factor determination.
arushi: Why is GROMACS so threatening? "The [defaults] directive should only be appearing at the top of your .top file where you choose the force field. If you are trying to mix two force fields, then you are *asking for trouble*. If a molecule .itp file tries to choose a force field, then whoever produced it is *asking for trouble*."
wesleybeckner: only you can bring balance to the forcefield, arushi
wesleybeckner: does anyone have an example script to handle their hyak jobs, e.g. daisy chaining jobs, resubmitting jobs...

wesleybeckner: this is a start
pfaendtner: arushi, you are asking for trouble by talking about this. It is basically a Roko’s Basilisk situation...
arushi: wesleybeckner:  pretty neat! I would use " while True" or " n=0; while n==0" (without updating n in my code) so it's goes infinitely without stressing about a counter value which is big enough 
arushi: Not a big deal though 
wesleybeckner: arushi: good point. If I ever had a really, really long job, using a dummy counter is just asking for trouble
arushi: Anyone with good resources to learn about making effective images/slides for presentations ? 
anotherjoshsmith: Yeah, I’ll just send you my old group meeting slides :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
houghb: I think I remember pfaendtner gave a powerpoint a couple years ago about how to give good presentations, maybe he can throw that in here
pfaendtner: Here are my slides from my DYSS talk last summer.
pfaendtner: Check out books by Edward Tufte - I think you can find a lot of nice stuff

wesleybeckner: People in our group have Lolo automatically sync to their physical hard drives is that correct?
pfaendtner: that is not correct.  many people remotely *mount* the drive, but this is totally different than sync.  I do not suggest doing an rsycn of lolo
houghb: I was talking to Jake after class today about publishing your code with academic papers and he pointed me to .  You can register with zenodo to get a DOI for a specific commit of your repository (hosted on github).  Zenodo will also archive a zip file that is available when someone searches for that DOI in case your github page ever goes away.
wesleybeckner: I think I created a zombie child on hyak
arushi: Microsoft Academic Search is another great tools for searching
arushi: Look at the recent paper that Jim sent around, which has a great citation list
arushi: <missing_message>
arushi: I like that it has the list of references, and citations ! I think it has the power to make a *paper citation graph* , which sounds really cool but I haven't used it yet
arushi: Has anyone made movies from VMD before?
arushi: Using ImageMagick, actually
arushi: Okay, just save it as image files, then use ffmpeg 
I used macports to install ffmpeg
luizoliveira: hey arushi I can’t thank you enough for the 

luizoliveira: it was really useful this weekend

arushi: BNS 109 I think
wesleybeckner: who here uses screen on hyak?
arushi: kayla
arushi: chrisfu and others. There seems to be a lot of controversy regarding using *p-value*. Can anyone who understands this please help me understand it too?


pfaendtner: This would be a great group discussion to have sometime! I am almost positive we are using the p-value analysis correctly in the KS test but it is a different type of analysis than is often used for comparing two population means.
pfaendtner: Group meetings for spring quarter will remain friday from 10am to 11am
houghb: Chris and I are presenting our final project for the ‘Software Engineering for Data Scientists’ course we’ve been taking tomorrow afternoon at a poster session.  The poster session is not just for our class, it is for general “Data Science in Engineering” projects.  If you want a snack break come chat us up.
luizoliveira: I’ll be there.
pfaendtner: If anyone is using Word2016 on Mac please open Activity Monitor and report if it is using a lot of CPU? I am consistently at 70%, which is ridiculous
luizoliveira: mine is 2011 and my CPU usage is  at 1%.  Maybe you have many files open or heavy figures...
pfaendtner: don’t upgrade - the 2011 is fine for me on cpu usage… 2016 is the bad one
chrisfu: I see the same thing when I compare 2016 to 2011 on my computer
pfaendtner: Well it is totally worth it because of all the new features… Oh wait..
luizoliveira: After the painful times writing my undergrad and master dissertation, I took a general solution to all the problems I had with Word: stop to use it for documents with more than one page.

pfaendtner: ChemNetworks could be very interesting - see software from the Clark group...
pfaendtner: please help w/the DYSS this summer - I strongly suggest Josh, Arushi, Chris and Wes all volunteer to be on the panel :simple_smile:
arushi: Yep, I informed Prof Cole I would help with the review panel.
wesleybeckner: just sent him an email :smile:
anotherjoshsmith: I’ll only volunteer if his group beats us in that MMA fight

luizoliveira: how many cores does the group have in total (pfaendtner-p1 and pfaendtner-p2)?
arushi: Our github Wiki now has a list of books we have in the group, with location/person who has borrowed it!
arushi: <missing_message>
wesleybeckner: what's the command to grab a node directly for an interactive session?
luizoliveira: I guess one of these 
wesleybeckner: so I know there's a way you can list prg nodes that are available and grab one directly. i don't think its on hyak wiki
luizoliveira: I see. I think you can use nodes=n0729:ppn=16
luizoliveira: nodestate pfaendtner
luizoliveira: it will give the busy nodes with the core number and the total of available cores
luizoliveira: as for now the last lines gave me
luizoliveira: n0727  Busy          4044235   batch  lflo      01:23:27:53  pfaendtner-p2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5 x 16core nodes free = 80 cores available to batch jobs in partition p2
luizoliveira: so it seems that n0729 is available
luizoliveira: almost sure that it should exist a command to give the node number of the available nodes
luizoliveira: but the way I described should work

arushi: The US Govt is cutting funding for engineering (NSF) and Basic Research (DOE)!
arushi: <missing_message>
arushi: "Without mentioning specific numbers, the budget resolution directs appropriators to provide “stable funding” for only three of NSF’s six research directorates—biology, computing and information science, and math and physical sciences—as well as NSF’s programs to strengthen science education. By omission, the resolution assigns second-class status to NSF’s other three research directorates—engineering, geoscience, and the social and behavioral sciences.

The language affecting DOE science is, frankly, harder to parse. The report hews to conventional wisdom, embraced by both Republicans and Democrats, that “the proper role of the federal government is to support basic research.” But it then declares that “several high-risk projects,” a phrase that is usually synonymous with basic research, “should be embarked on by the private sector instead” of by DOE’s Office of Science."
houghb: A few of us are planning to take the light rail downtown for lunch on Wednesday.  Who is free to join us? (we can plan it so we’re back in time for the JRT in the afternoon)
houghb: Also, if you have eateries downtown you are excited to try please throw out some suggestions (pescetarian friendly)  :simple_smile:
pfaendtner: Definitely goto Salumi at some point. Not sure if it is pescetarian though. It is right by the Pioneer Square station
houghb: pro-tip: I didn’t realize we didn’t cover this when introducing Slack to the group.  If you don’t like getting notifications all the time from a particular channel (like prg_github, researchpapers) you can mute that channel and only look at it when you want.
kayla: What time should we head out to lunch tomorrow? And where should we go?
houghb: Wes is coming and has a meeting at 2:30 so we need to be back by then.  I am flexible and can leave any time.  Does anyone else have time constraints?
houghb: I haven’t looked into places to eat yet (unfortunately Jim’s suggestion, Salumi, doesn’t seem to have anything I can eat)
pfaendtner: If you guys can make it to Marination that would also be killer. There is Marination station near broadway and Pike and another Marination near Westlake and 6th
pfaendtner: the kimchi rice is insane.  *insane*
pfaendtner: Kizuki Ramen and Izakaya is also _off the chain_
houghb: Marination has fish options for me and looks good.  When I used to work downtown there were some good places we would walk to in Pike Place and that gives some additional options if people want to grab different food and then eat in the park next to the market.  It’s been over ten years since I worked there so the particular places I remember may not be around anymore, but I’m sure there are options in the market if we just want to wing it.
houghb: To start the conversation on lunch departure time, I propose we leave Benson at 11:15.  How is that for others?
wesleybeckner: sounds good to me
miketung: sounds good to me
kayla: works for me

pfaendtner: did anyone just get the message I sent to grads@cheme ? I never know if my messages go out
houghb: yes
kayla: If anyone has ever had a problem getting kicked off Hyak after being idle for a little bit, Vance suggested the following workaround, verified by Helmut: ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -X 
houghb: I don’t remember where off the top of my head, but you can also specify a default ServerAliveInterval in some ssh config file on your machine(s), which does this same thing but for all your ssh connections so you don’t need to remember to do it
pfaendtner: congrats to Yeneneh - 2nd author on a JACS Communication with Tobias
pfaendtner: Kayla and I also compiled serial GMX 5.1.2 this morning. The same setup commands can be used and now you can use some of the gromacs tools on the frontend.  for example “gmx grompp”  since “gmx_mpi grompp” will never work on the frontend
helmut: Tomorrow Wednesday, who's in for lunch on the Ave? Preferably 12.30
houghb: I’ve got an important meeting downtown tomorrow in the early afternoon, so won’t be able to make it to the ave.  Have fun!

houghb: it depends on how you structured your existing repo.  In my case I only have one UWPRG repo, and it is for a  dedicated project, so I just added my collaborators to that specific repo.  If I remember correctly, your wabbithole repo is a collection of multiple projects (?) - if that’s the case then you would want to make a new repo for a dedicated project and add a collaborator to that one

wesleybeckner: does anyone else get annoyed with the auto scroll that happens when you execute an ipynb cell? know how to turn off?
houghb: are you saying that when you execute a cell the window scrolls as new output is produced?  If so that doesn’t happen for me (when I execute a cell the output continues to print and goes off screen below, then I can scroll down to see it).  Once output has been produced you can click to the left of the output (below the `In [*cell num*]:` label) and it will toggle between showing output, showing output in a window with a scroll bar, and showing no output.
miketung: ctrl+enter will stay in the same cell

luizoliveira: anotherjoshsmith I can do that 
anotherjoshsmith: cooo, thanks! i have class at 11, so one of the other slots will work better if anyone else is game, or would switch for the 11 oclock spot on thursday
houghb: If luizoliveira can take your Wednesday spot I can give you my Thursday spot and then I will take Luiz’s spot (but I will be at a conference on Wednesday so can’t trade you directly).  This would mean:
Wed @ 10:30 - Luiz
Thurs @ 9:30 - Josh 
Thurs @ 11:00 - Blake
anotherjoshsmith: Sounds good!
chrisfu: I can also just swap with you directly if it would make it easier for everyone
anotherjoshsmith: Yeah, let's do that instead haha. Thanks y'all!
wesleybeckner: who is alexxyc on our uwprg?
luizoliveira: He is an undergrad. He was talking with me and Chris last Wednesday ( I think you saw him). His name is actually Yeuchuan.
wesleybeckner: oh yeah.
luizoliveira: helmut: and chrisfu I think I found an explanation from that delta function we discussed Friday on the Bussi paper ( Entropy 16, 163 (2014) ). Maybe you have already figured out. I put here as may be of interest to others:

anotherjoshsmith: Anyone know the topic of today’s data science seminar?
houghb: Just want to let everyone know that github changed their pricing structure and upgraded us to *unlimited private repositories*, so there’s no need to ask anymore if you can make additional private repos.
luizoliveira: <missing_message>
luizoliveira: This guy went a bit far
luizoliveira: but the conclusion is great
luizoliveira: Conclusion
The principle of frequency isn't profound; but it is effective. Just because the console is a powerful way to compute doesn't mean we shouldn't look for ways to make it more efficient. Logging activity and then mining that data is a low-cost way for console users to discover their most frequent tasks. And, once those tasks are discovered, users can devise methods (or additional shell scripts) to make them go faster.
luizoliveira: and a way to improve frequency in PRG’s everyday life is to use this: 
luizoliveira: I’ve sent it before. When wesleybeckner started to use it I was next to him and it took exactly 17 seconds to do all the "procedure”. :smiley:
luizoliveira: This can be useful 
luizoliveira: I've just used avogadro, really simple (maybe too simple). I think almost everyone in the group is using  gaussianView, but sometimes is important to have further options.
caitwolf: Hey all! I’ve been talking to David Beck and Pearl Philip about getting a machine learning group together in the department. It’s still in the earliest stages of planning, but initially we are thinking of starting the group as a monthly informal discussion group for people working on or interested in machine learning at any experience level. In the future, it could develop to a more formal seminar or remain informal, depending on what members would like to see. At this point, I just wanted to throw this out there and see if there is any interest at all as we continue to figure out more of the details. Let me know if this would be something you would like to see in the future and definitely feel free to send me any suggestions and/or questions.
anotherjoshsmith: I'm definitely interested! Let me know if there's anything I can do to help with organization
yeneneh: I am interested!
houghb: I am interested

chrisfu: i am interested
arushi: Guys, I think I took someone else's token home instead of mine? Anyone facing trouble with logging onto hyak?
miketung: Anyone knows the command to check whole directory memory size?
luizoliveira: du -h
arushi: du -sh * | sort &gt; filesize.list
miketung: I want total memory size
arushi: go up one folder and use it
miketung: Arushi's works, thanks!
luizoliveira: du -h give the total size too
luizoliveira: no need to go up
anotherjoshsmith: Nice intro to D3 for complete noobs like me

miketung: Hi guys, I brought some snacks from Taiwan. It's at basement. Feel free to eat it please!
anotherjoshsmith: Howdy y'all! Arushi, Wesley, and I will be PRGylating the Data Visualization poster session this evening from 5-8pm in the Allen Center. Stop by for oodles of fun!
wesleybeckner: do people publish  without error bars if the error bars are trivially small and only obscure the data being plotted?
luizoliveira: yes, they do
luizoliveira: from "New Approach for Investigating Reaction Dynamics and Rates with Ab Initio Calculations”
luizoliveira: Using all of the data in Table 1, we verified that Arrhenius-like behavior was found and calculated a range of possible activation energies (Figure 2). As shown in Table 1, the symbol size is larger than the standard error from the uncertainty
houghb: I think "trivially small" should be explored further.  I often see papers with a sentence like what Luiz posted (“symbol size is larger than the error bar”), which is just another way of saying the error bars were actually plotted you just can’t see them.  Sometimes when the error bars are not smaller than the symbol itself I have seen plots where they only include the error bar for every nth data point (assuming all the error bars are similar sizes, and you describe that you’re doing this in the legend) - and that way it still shows that you’ve considered the error, but you don’t clutter then entire plot with error bars on every point...
arushi: PRG should participate in this 
luizoliveira: boltzmann
slackbot: woof!
arushi: Our next investment should be ...

If you have a minute and don’t mind gaming the hiring teams with me I would appreciate some stars on these three projects (it’s like kindergarten for adults!):


<https://github.com/houghb/ligpy>
<https://github.com/houghb/savvy>

To star someone’s work just log in to github, go the project page, and click the star button in the top right. You’re also welcome to click Watch if you want, but stars are what I want :star::star::star: Thanks!

houghb: I am going to be emptying out my desk this weekend and can’t take my plants home with me (our cats eat any plants inside the house).  One of the plants is dead (not a good indoor plant) and I will be tossing it, but two are still in good shape, does anyone want to keep them?  They’re easy to care for - I fertilize them twice a year and split a water bottle between the two of them every week or two.
kayla: what kind of plants are they?
houghb: One is called Sansevieria and it is in a pot that can fit on a desk.  The other is Pothos, it is the big vine that is hanging down from the shelf on the wall next to my desk and it is pretty large.
kayla: I’ll take the Sansevieria for sure if that’s okay!
houghb: Awesome
kayla: Woohoo!
luizoliveira: Blake I’ll see with Patricia, but I’m really interested by the Pothos
slackbot: wooh Blake!
houghb: Also, is anyone interested in the standing desk that I built (it sits on top of a regular desk to convert it to standing)?  I will not be taking it either.
anotherjoshsmith: dibs
maneki_neko: :q
wesleybeckner: who agrees with this: 
What sets a first-rate scientific article apart from the
thousands of forgettable publications that appear in the
literature every year? For a very few, content alone ensures
that the paper will be widely cited. But for most,
it is the way the article is written.

pfaendtner: what can we learn from this article to get more citations?

pfaendtner: when should we have group meeting during fall quarter
luizoliveira: I vote for Tuesday 12:30 - 2pm starting September 20. :wink:
kayla: That seems fine to me. Though I guess I'd prefer it earlier in the morning. 
arushi: Some people are taking Machine Learning ( T,Th 9:30AM to 10:50 AM) in the fall quarter, for sure. Possibly trying for statistics (T,Th 1:30pm-2:50pm).
luizoliveira: I also prefer earlier n the mor
maneki_neko: I like that time too. I would probably be able to make it since my classes end at 11:30.
luizoliveira: Ning
luizoliveira: But there will be many prelims in fall and 109 is disputed
luizoliveira: Arushi when are you guys going to be sure about Statistics class?
wesleybeckner: don't change the spaces
wesleybeckner: keep them the same. change hurts
wesleybeckner: change hurts us all
arushi: When Chris makes up his mind!
wesleybeckner: Chris is a tool
wesleybeckner: a tool for excellence
arushi: :bowtie:
wesleybeckner: Oh and I was commenting on the desk spaces. Debbie just came in to talk about it. sorry for the confusion downstairs crew
luizoliveira: did you guys decide on the statistics class?
arushi: gonna take it!
luizoliveira: Ok

luizoliveira: Another possibity is Wed from 1h30-3. Let me know if that works.
coco: “I am awake"
pfaendtner: download statistics on the JPCA Reaction paper since it was published! 2487 downloads!

kayla: Sweeeet! Thats cool. Wish that translated to citations ;) 
pfaendtner: (for reference the PTMetaD-WTE paper and the Langmuir peptide adsorption paper each have ~900 downloads)
kayla: Awesome!! 
pfaendtner: the only major conclusion I Have is that getting selected for “Editor’s Choice” leads to a huge increase in citations
pfaendtner: errrrrrrr downloads
pfaendtner: we will see if that translates to citations or not
kayla: Which paper was selected for editors choice?
pfaendtner: Kelly
kayla: Oh wait, Kelly's right?
kayla: Yep 
pfaendtner: it is still #4 on total download list for JPCA for the whole year
kayla: That's crazy. 
kayla: Super cool. 
kayla: Kelly went out with a bang!
pfaendtner: true story
pfaendtner: if people in the group want to know how to calculate thermochemical properties, locate transition states, and calculate rate constants I can give some lectures on this after Luiz lectures on DFT

chrisfu: :+1:
miketung: Thanks everyone!
eprates: Hi guys! Thanks a lot for having me at your lab. I had a great time! Talking with you was very helpful to me, especially for the class on MetaD with Jim, Kayla's help with PBMetaD, Arushi's explanation on clustering analysis and for all the discussion with the group.  Now, I wanted to ask to whoever find sometime an opinion related to the MetaD study of the peptide linkers :slightly_smiling_face:
eprates: The conformations of the peptide linkers at lower radius of gyration are much more numerous than at higher Rg, right? So, naturally, the simulations will spend a looot of time sampling the collapsed linker. My first idea was to set a lower wall potential at a cutoff for radius of gyration. By doing so, I will guarantee that the extended conformations are extensively sampled and converged. I am considering the collapsed linker are not as important, since there would be proteins connected to each terminal of the linker. However, I was thinking on after this convergence, turn off the lower wall in the same simulation, so that I can draft this region in the free energy profile. At least I can show this collapsed conformations exist.
eprates: What do you think about that?
pfaendtner: Hi Erica, you would be justified in doing this piecewise as long as you can interconvert between low Rg collapsed states without going to a large extended state.
pfaendtner: Another option is just to run the simulation with a minimum distance between the end of the termini. You could take distance between COM of 1st two and last two residues and make an educated guess as to the SMALLEST value that distance could take in a real cellulosome.  For example, would it be fine to assume that the linker ends will never be closer than 1 nm? something like that should be reasonable. In that case your “lowest” rG value will be somewhat bounded by this value and may prevent you from seeing ‘total collapse’ …
wesleybeckner: houghb have you seen this employed anywhere? 
eprates: Thanks, Jim. I will do what you suggested.
houghb: wesleybeckner I haven’t seen that used before.  We’re using mostly sklearn and starting to grow into spark here.
wesleybeckner: houghb cool, thanks man!
pfaendtner: you can submit hyak jobs from the command line with the -W directive.  This is in contrast to using #PBS -W within your .pbs file.  So in this case I submitted this job "qsub -W depend=afterany:4760062 gaussian.pbs“ and it will wait until that jobid is finished before submitting it.  I could just type “qsub gaussian.pbs” and it would launch immediately.  Nice not to have to modify each pbs file!

pfaendtner: some notes from a side conversation with Arushi. Just want you guys to appreciate how much we owe the NSF!
pfaendtner: It is. NSF has funded my whole academic career:  IGERT for 4 years  , postdoc fellowship, my 1st grant was a 2-year research initiation grant on protein surface interactions, my 1st big grant as NSF CAREER ( on enyzme+ILs) , and I used NSF to teach an international workshop and start a new international collaboration.  My first big grant as a tenured professor is the NRT/DIRECT grant!

[10:51]  
our group owes everything to the NSF
pfaendtner: Highlights from the MACCR meeting today
pfaendtner: 1) screaming match between two grown men
pfaendtner: 2) someone who has apparently worked in the chemical physics field for sevearl decades claiming “It is impossible to calculate a rate in the NVT or NPT ensemble.  Because the adjustable parameters might change things”
kayla: sounds like a productive, insightful meeting.
kayla: lol
pfaendtner: we will take care of this NVT/NPT thing so there is no ambiguity after the next time I present
arushi: not sure I understood the NVT/NPT thing :confused:
pfaendtner: it is an ignorant view of what a thermostat or barostat does to the dynamics of a system
arushi: ah
pfaendtner: we will do some simulations so that I can tremendously show these fair people that rates from NVT are perfectly fine.
pfaendtner: it will be a fun post-prelim exercise for dennis
kayla: haha
pfaendtner: the ensemble issue has also caused screaming matches at this meeting before
kayla: what, that an ensemble of short trajectories can be analyzed the same as a long, continuous one?
pfaendtner: that is more enemble avg = time average, which is a different postulate of stat mech
pfaendtner: this person is saying that because velocities are changed via the action of the thermostat that the rates that are obtained cannot be right
pfaendtner: lots of pros just have their things they like to say (I’m sure I have my own).  But this is  just flat wrong.  Actually as Pauli said - “it is not even wrong”
kayla: ahh i see
pfaendtner: but that person's view is so ignorant of how a thermostat or barostat works that it is not even possible to have a starting point unless you explain from the beginning what it means to be coupled to an external bath.  It goes to very definition of an ensemble
kayla: what did they say when you told them we use only ergodic thermostats, etc
pfaendtner: this wasn’t about me - I didn’t even get in the mix. It is so stupid I just roll my eyes w/the other people who do MD :
slackbot: <missing_message>
kayla: ohhhh, i thought this happened while you were presenting or something!
kayla: whew
pfaendtner: no, I try and avoid the drama at these meetings.  I did give another prof a sic burn though - he talked right before me and spent 15 mins explaining how it was impossible to on-the-fly determine species and reactions from MD trajectories, so I added a result from Shaohui’s 2014 paper and stated flatly “this is a solved problem and should not be further investigated”
slackbot: Do, or do not. There is no try.
kayla: hahah
kayla: awesome
pfaendtner: everyone was complaining about how shitty MD is, and so I added in one of my slides that we would “_now have a moment of silence so everyone can get all of their anger about MD out of their hearts_"
pfaendtner: and I actually paused my talk and had a moment of silence
kayla: really?
kayla: that is hilarious!
pfaendtner: for serious
kayla: wow
kayla: brave
pfaendtner: I don’t think that is the quote that was on my slide but that is what I said
kayla: what was the audience reaction
pfaendtner: people thought it was hilarious - because they know I was making fun of the screamers
kayla: what meeting are you at again?
kayla: remind me never to present there
kayla: ohh, AFOSR right?
pfaendtner: MACCCR = MULTI ANGECY COMBUSTION CHEMISTRY COMMITTEE REVIEW

luizoliveira: During TACC, I was surprised by the number of people taking pictures during talks. I saw people taking pictures of entire presentations. However, I was happy when someone asked me to take a picture of my poster. Later, talking with Kayla and Chris, I realized that that could be a person trying to “steal” my unpublished work. 
Searching a conference information I found this: 
pfaendtner, what’s your opinion on that? In a conference, without such strict polices, should we allow people to take picture of our posters? In a talk, should we stop and tell someone to do not take pictures or record our presentation?
pfaendtner: I would not stop and tell someone not to do it - they could also be wanting to get a reminder of your work so they can cite your work later on :slightly_smiling_face: we don’t really present work that is in danger of being scooped (IMO) ...
wesleybeckner: this looks like it could be useful to some of us.

luizoliveira: pfaendtner has the seminar that was supposed to be today ML + Quantum Chemistry been canceled only on our calendar or really canceled?
luizoliveira: oh, really canceled I found it
luizoliveira: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: it is canceled
pfaendtner: #sad
pfaendtner: :crying_cat_face:
arushi: I hope everybody is coming to seminar today :D Super excited to have Chris present (although none of this will be about my work) !

luizoliveira: For annual billing the prize is 
$1,360 per year for 17 users   (2 months free!)
luizoliveira: Monthly Billing 
$136 per month for 17 users (You'll spend $1,632 per year)
luizoliveira: this is for the standard plan
arushi: Our group GitHub definitely has a way to make a forum. So errors can be posted on it and everyone gets an email
arushi: And replies to the email get posted on the forum 
arushi: Almost like Stackoverfllw
arushi: And free, so
pfaendtner: that is kinda spendy - I feel like the group would rather have $1360 for conference travel or candy
kayla: Defs candy. :candy:
luizoliveira: or happy hours..
pfaendtner: $1360 in peanut butter cups!!!
kayla: Ewww
arushi: Okay, so go here 
Click on *New Issue*. Write your title, text, etc. Assign it to someone on the right side *Assignees* - all of them will get an email about it so feel free to tag more people so that you get answers quicker. They can reply to the email to answer your query and that'll get posted on github. When your issue is solved, just write how it was finally solved so everyone know and *Close* the issue. You can add *Labels* to each issue. And all this will be maintained on the website like a querying forum.
arushi: 
30 GB backup, that's also backed up by UW, available to students, staff, etc
luizoliveira: this was supposed to be the syllabus?
chrisfu: dumbledore's army is meeting in B17

arushi: Woah. I never got his email :( :)
pfaendtner: y can't you use machine learning to find my house
arushi: Get data from your dog walking app to figure out the periphery in which Boltzmann poops
slackbot: woof!
arushi: Your house is likely in the center. Normal probability with tails outwards

kayla: Hah! Definitely made me lol 
kayla: :joy:
coco: :weary:
pfaendtner: grad students would you rather have regularly scheduled meetings for WIN or do you want to keep w/JRT?
wesleybeckner: JRT
arushi: Scheduled
kayla: Scheduled 
pfaendtner: "hashtag interesting"
wesleybeckner: why don't you guys like JRT? it's free flowing for real. Like Pocahontas down the river bend. I can't deal. Unbelievable.
wesleybeckner: You never step in the same JRT twice. 


anotherjoshsmith: I support that rationale and JRT
kayla: I mean, JRT is totes fine for me as well 
arushi: Okay then ... Jrt
coco: Happy New Year PRG！
kayla: Yes happy new year!!! :tada:
pfaendtner: happy new year everyone
pfaendtner: ya’ll ready to get back in the lab and hit it?

coco: I am down stair
coco: Probably moving back tomorrow...:joy:

wesleybeckner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: anyone know if there is a remote for the old TV (now in my office) downstairs?
anotherjoshsmith: haven't seen one. could be in a drawer of one of the older desks
luizoliveira: I have this one, don’t think is the correct one though
kayla: Thanks y'all!! 
pfaendtner: luizoliveira  - 1991 called.  Wants its remote back.
luizoliveira: :relaxed: I bought a (new 2017 model) TV last week and the remote is similar
coco: <missing_message>

luizoliveira: does someone know if, in PLUMED, there is any additional difference between RESTRAINT and UPPER_WALLS other than the expressions of the potentials?
pfaendtner: make sure there is not a 1/2 difference in spring constants
wesleybeckner: Looks like most of campus lost power just now
luizoliveira: at my place too
anotherjoshsmith: Ours went out for a half second
ldgibson: Same here, it's back now 
kayla: Ours too!
kayla: we got high wind warnings this morning
kayla: for the whole county
kayla: could be that
kayla: Also, did that loss of power knock out hyak or something?
kayla: Hopefully the backup generators kicked on, but I can’t log in!
coco: :weary:
anotherjoshsmith: Cause unknown  :ghost: 
coco: hyak is down 
luizoliveira: yeap
coco: Benson is getting cold :expressionless:
wesleybeckner: no wifi :no_mouth:
anotherjoshsmith: My poor iMac won't even talk to me :sob:
pfaendtner: this is how you access journal articles from home
pfaendtner: 1) goto the page at JACS when it is saying you cannot access it

[2:57]  
then paste this into your browser

[2:57]  
javascript:void(location.href=%22)

[2:58]  
it is called the “UW library proxy bookmark”

[2:58]  
and lets you get access

coco: It’s awesome!
kayla: Hyak is baaaaack! 
pfaendtner: RUN FOR THE NODES - RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN
kayla: Hahaha scheduler is still down though! 
coco: 🤣🤣🤣
kejiawu: may I know which room is for our group meeting?:sweat_smile:
wesleybeckner: 109!
pfaendtner: Benson 109
kejiawu: thx!
gdavids3: So is Kayla's happy hour tomorrow at 5 or is it next week when Arushi actually returns?
slackbot: :beer: *slurp* *burp*
pfaendtner: good question! kayla  is it tomorrow or next week?
pfaendtner: I think next week - I thought arushi was already back :open_mouth:
kayla: tomorrow i thought. ohhh right.
kayla: arushi isn’t back!
kayla: we should wait!
kayla: or do two? :wink:
kayla: i can’t do it next wednesday
pfaendtner: lets go - we do lots of celebrations and have some upcoming 1st papers, etc
pfaendtner: also we can do lunch at big time after painting assuming we do it on sunday and start early enough
pfaendtner: everybody can’t goto every one :slightly_smiling_face:
kayla: true. so tomorrow?
kayla: sweet!
pfaendtner: you and I will go :slightly_smiling_face: others will join too I guess : )
arushi: Haha yeah !! We will have lots to celebrate :D enjoy !!
wesleybeckner: anyone have a mag-safe (pre-usb c) mac book charger they aren't using anymore?
pfaendtner: I have many
pfaendtner: do you need it today?
wesleybeckner: I need one yes please
pfaendtner: hmmmmmmm do you want an apple cinema display to go with it?
pfaendtner: come get it
wesleybeckner: actually this is awesome. so many monitors now
anotherjoshsmith: damn, ask and you shall receive + apple cinema
pfaendtner: it is an old display that doesn’t work w/our new ones
pfaendtner: wesleybeckner is a regular Al Gore
wesleybeckner: :thumbsup_all:
anotherjoshsmith: :joy: Gore 2020
luizoliveira: If you guys want to listen to Martin Karplus: 
luizoliveira: at the beginning is in French but he switches to English
wesleybeckner: is this cool or nah? 
houghb: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: new guidelines for theory papers to JPC A/B/C - worth a read
pfaendtner: Added a new github repo in the main UWPRG team to share general articles
luizoliveira: Almost everyone is asking for an extra monitor.  Just grab one at B17, first come first served. Please leave at least four for the linux computers. But I guess we should have  enough, any way we can take one or two from Wes :wink:
pfaendtner: Cheap to order more. Multi screens are great 
luizoliveira: wesleybeckner, please share a picture with everyone once you finish your setup, you really looks great
pfaendtner: i miss you guys - I can feel that PRG left the 2nd floor :cry: just like when Alderaan blew up and Obi Wan sensed a great disturbance in the force
luizoliveira: Master students, we still have 3 Macs desktops you can use, so one of you will be a happy Ubuntu (Linux)  user.  I can help if you encounter problems, because of that (to make my life easier) maybe daniel or ksakloth you are the ones that will use it as we are at B49. Ubuntu is really user friendly, I learned a lot using it during my PhD.
kayla: No idea what you are talking about Jim haha, but it is certainly a weird change!
kayla: It is nice all being down here together though
coco: pfaendtner Now you have a yoga room
kayla: Or crossfit room
pfaendtner: lol kayla - it is a Star Wars reference.  You know as you put it - “the movie that has the little green guy and the light sword”
kayla: ohhh that one!
kayla: haha
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: this would go perfect in 239
pfaendtner: only problems: only 320 lbs of plates and not sure what happens to the floor when I drop the barbell
luizoliveira: oh Kayla, Star Wars movies (even the new bad ones) are far superior to any of the Harry Potters movies. You must watch them. They will change your life…
kayla: I sincerely doubt that!!!!!
kayla: HP4life
kejiawu: luizoliveira luiz where are the macs for us? I see 2 in B17 actually..
luizoliveira: I have two here, one of those there doesn’t work. I’m pretty sure.
kejiawu: :sweat_smile:I see!
pfaendtner: more screens
pfaendtner: luiz can order some cable ties on amazon to keep everything tidy
pfaendtner: there are plenty of solutions to minimize cable clutter
pfaendtner: (if you guys want)
ksakloth: luizoliveira sure no problem , anything is fine
luizoliveira: cool, I’m going to set up it for you
luizoliveira: we should have more news about the new desks for B17 by noon tomorrow
wesleybeckner: oh lol there it is!
kayla: Haha I'm a big fan of my new emoji :) 
wesleybeckner: :laughing:
luizoliveira: we got 5 new desks for B17
kayla: yayyyy!
kayla: they are ours officially??
kayla: can we move them in?
luizoliveira: yes, we can!
anotherjoshsmith: B17 is now habitable pfaendtner
pfaendtner: picture or it dint happen anotherjoshsmith
anotherjoshsmith: just need to find a home for the books!
pfaendtner: what was the net change in seats in b17?
anotherjoshsmith: +3
pfaendtner: major density increase. nice
anotherjoshsmith: Those new little desks were clutch!
pfaendtner: we will have to figure out if they work OK for folks or if they are misery to work @
kayla: does anyone know the password for the mac on Nikita’s desk?
luizoliveira: I should have
kayla: any luck?
pfaendtner: is it “password”
kayla: we got it
luizoliveira: it was the crap one
arushi: password is my password but maybe I’ll change it now
pfaendtner: adding ivan to our slack team - DACB and I are co-advising him (but he is in the beck group) - continuing blake’s project but will be working on combustion reaction networks ( luizoliveira chrisfu sarahalamdari ldgibson )
slackbot: wooh Blake!
ivancjr: ivancjr has joined the channel
daniel: Hi ivancjr  good to see you lol
houghb: pfaendtner ivancjr not sure exactly what is planned for continuing my project but happy to chat sometime in Feb (or later if Ivan needs some time for onboarding) about things I would do better/differently now that I have some more experience
pfaendtner: thanks blake!!!
slackbot: wooh Blake!
pfaendtner: errrrboddy - I defs have the flu. I won’t come back to work until my fever is down. If you are running a fever, you are contagious so please stay home and rest up
pfaendtner: It is not optional for me two miss too much CrossFit so I am going to defeat the flu by tomorrow morning by sheer force of will.  wish me luck
pfaendtner: other preventatives: wash your hands A LOT, focus on avoiding touching your face with your fingers. The flu is spread usually by people coughing , virus being airbone or surface bound (cool protein surface interactions) and then someone touching that surface and then touching a mucus membrane like eyes mouth or nose. _a lot of cool biophysics in there, but i just dont want you to get sick_
pfaendtner: by the way tomorrow’s CEI seminar will be excellent coverage of data science topics in energy - the guy sergei k is a total beast
luizoliveira: oh man, hope you feel better soon.
pfaendtner: I need a few people to meet with visitor Michael Shirts monday morning
arushi: Me!
pfaendtner: you got it :wink:
pfaendtner: He is coming to be B17 at 9:30 and you can do whatever you want until 10 am , just deliver him to Holmberg office at 10 am please
pfaendtner: 1-2 more can join too
pfaendtner: you can meet him in the B17 office or see if the 137A conference room is open and take him up there (check @ front desk for reservation possibility)
pfaendtner: thanks!!
arushi: anotherjoshsmith is in too!
pfaendtner: cool -I trust you guys to handle it :slightly_smiling_face: people love meeting our group so it will go great.  thanks!!!
pfaendtner: back to sleep
arushi: take care!
arushi: chrisfu probably wants in too!
arushi: He TA'd for Shirts as an undergrad. Talk about connections!
wesleybeckner: great nature news article about data science and materials 
ivancjr: thanks houghb, I am going over your codes these couple days and I will see how far I can get by myself first!
kayla: I might not be in tomorrow y'all. I'm not feeling super well either. We shall see! :face_with_thermometer:
wesleybeckner: Hey guys I've caught the bug. I apologize in advance for missing Josh's lesson :mask: :pill: 
pfaendtner: sorry you will miss kalinin seminar , but totally understand. it is related to your work w/ginger group.  coco  and arushi  and take good notes for you :slightly_smiling_face:
coco: :ok_hand::skin-tone-2:
maneki_neko: Everyone is dropping like flies. Almost the entire math faculty at Bellevue College was gone the other day. :cold_sweat:
pfaendtner: is anyone available to present with the HPC club on Wed Feb 8 from 3:30 to 4:20 at Bellevue college? would be awesome to have PRG support there!
maneki_neko: If anyone is going, I can present with them if that's appropriate.
pfaendtner: : there has possibly been a shooting at red square. If you are on campus please stay away from that area 
kejiawu: that’s scary!
kayla: Very 
pfaendtner: We will know more soon. Campus republicans invited a controversial conservative speaker and there were protests of him on red square. Not many details yet. Just wanted to let people know in case you don't get UW Alerts on your phone 
maneki_neko: Someone did get shot.
maneki_neko: <missing_message>
luizoliveira: It was already crazy at 7 over there. Lots of cops 
ivancjr: politics..
pfaendtner: Y can't we all just do MD and get along 
coco: I left
pfaendtner: new MS Office updates from 1/7/17 - should improve performance on mac
kayla: Finally! Current version drains my Mac's energy so fast! 
pfaendtner: JRT by appointment only this week.  If you are stuck on research and need help send me a DM and we can work something out.  I’m finishing 2 grants this week and that should be last of the proposal writing until end of Feb, I think…
pfaendtner:  &lt;&lt;— battery interested people
maneki_neko:  is anyone going to the ACS conference this April?
arushi: kaylaaa
pfaendtner: jimmmmmmmm
pfaendtner: group, you will be happy to know I’m almost all caught up! paper editing is coming!!!
pfaendtner: and more info on research / projects for all the noobs
luizoliveira: For the B17 residents,

I brought the small printer to B49. 
Does any of you have the IP or the printer name? I couldn't find it. 
I was planning to bring the one in B239 and install Wednesday night for you guys but talking with Coco we couldn’t decide a good place to put it. 
Some suggestions: Arushi's desk, if she's ok of course; move the couch and put the printer there and finally next to Keija's desk. For the last two options, you will need a desk. 
You can take back the one in B49. And also take the printer and install it whenever you want. 

Also, you need to connect it by cable, the eprint functionality for some reason is not working.
slackbot: coo coo for cocoa puffs!!!
pfaendtner: filling out my annual report is one of my least favorite activities
anotherjoshsmith: Are you going to include Wesley's haircut in your annual report? That was quite a milestone for the group
pfaendtner: did not result in funds, pubs or awards - probably not
pfaendtner: unless Great Clips got recognized in Salon Today for his cut
anotherjoshsmith: Let me check, I wouldn't rule it out
pfaendtner: I wouldn’t be surprised - it was a masterpiece
pfaendtner: Robin Shannon from the David Glowacki lab is visiting this week. He is super cool! We will have an extra group meeting one day this week so he can tell us about his research and Chris and Luiz and I will probably take him for dinner and a beer or two on Tue evening. Anyone else from group is welcome to join for dinner - just let Chris know if you want to go. Please feel free to invite him to lunch, coffee, etc while he is here! Thanks!
arushi: Sure! Where will he be sitting ?
pfaendtner: figuring it out - probably in the office by Chris and Luiz
pfaendtner: ^ ps Tue is self-pay we will try to pick a place that is not too spendy , any suggestions?
slackbot: Do, or do not. There is no try.
chrisfu: Jim, Luiz, and I are planning to going to happy hour/ early dinner with Robin at Ivars  today. If anyone if interested please let me know so we don't leave you behind
slackbot: :beer: *slurp* *burp*
luizoliveira: coco
slackbot: coo coo for cocoa puffs!!!
luizoliveira: sorry I can’t help now with the printer. Maybe tomorrow night
coco: NP~
pfaendtner: strongly encourage someone from the group to give an HPCC talk this quarter and next quarter.  I cannot prioritize funding PhD students and postdocs to goto a conference when you don’t take advantage of local opportunities.  PRG should have at minimum of 2 and preferably 3 talks/year @ HPCC (at least that is my dream :)
daniel: wes is this yours?
pfaendtner: I am bored sitting in my office right now
wesleybeckner: Ah yeah did you grab that? daniel 
daniel: yep will give you tomorrow
pfaendtner: maybe the bottle ate your powerbar
wesleybeckner: :joy:
pfaendtner: I will not nominate any seminar visitors for ChemE seminar next year. You guys can pick someone if you want. Should be a ChemE prof in USA. 4th year or higher. If not tenured they should have a record of pubs and funding. 
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: looks like Win10 now has Ubuntu via the WSL! This could be great for windows users in the group and python, etc… arushi  ldgibson ksakloth gdavids3
daniel: I just installed git bash on my wins and found it's super hard to use... but I can't go repair my MBP without an alternative NB. Now I am considering to install Linux.

pfaendtner: ^ watched this with Jill the other night, it is great! wesleybeckner RFBs!!!
daniel: Hey guys are you annoyed by `.Ds_store` files like me when you do `git status` or `ls -al`? For OS X under 10.10, you can install Asepsis (an app which can redirect `.Ds_store` files to a special location `/usr/local/.dscage`). For 10.11 and 10.12, follow this instruction: . After doing all the steps, you can type `sudo find / -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \;` to delete all existing `.Ds_store` files, and all future files will be in `/usr/local/.dscage`. It works fine on my MBP.
For one who has concern:
```*What happens if .DS_Store file is deleted?*
The files aren't protected, they are just hidden. A Mac user can delete a .DS_Store file without any additional level of permissions like being a root user. Will the deletion of .DS_Store impose a crucial problem? Apparently, no. Unless you have customized a folder with flying colors or maybe even a background image, there isn't supposed to be an issue with the deletion of .DS_Store file. However, we will strongly recommend keeping the .DS_Store files intact and undeleted.```
What is `.Ds_Store`? <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store>
daniel: oops wrong place I just want to post it in DIRECT
pfaendtner: ^ you can delete posts if you don’t want them there
arushi: *Recently downloaded Obabel* - used for interconversion between molecular formats ( pdb, mol, gro and so many more)

Found it especially useful since it takes the .log output of Gaussian runs and converts it to any format (xyz, pdb,etc). Before I knew about this, I would write a painful script to do it!
kayla: Good find! I’ve always just loaded Gaussian .log files into Gaussview and then saved as a pdb file.
pfaendtner: Oh man I wish I knew.  I have used babel since I was a grad student :0
daniel: a question, what is difference between .login and .bashrc? I mean, actually I put all those alias and export things in .bashrc and it works fine.
daniel: on hyak
wesleybeckner: bashrc is sourced whenever you create a terminal session. login is sourced whenever you login to hyak. so in the case of hyak these are functionally the same? maybs
pfaendtner: what bout .bash_profile?
pfaendtner: I have a bag of milano double chocolate cookies - anyone want it ?
slackbot: <missing_message>
wesleybeckner: we also have cookies, scones, and donuts in b17. they need a home
slackbot: <missing_message>
daniel: pfaendtner I googled it before. profile is for login shell  like (ssh) and rc is for no-login shell. In Mac OSX there is no bashrc because by default the system will create a login shell environment. And most of time, linux user will add '’'
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
   source ~/.bashrc
fi’’’ 
Then there is no big difference?
arushi: nope
arushi: I think we create the .login instead of adding stuff to bashrc as an extra level of security for when files get deleted or paths get messed up or something
pfaendtner: Hyak admins strongly advice against having path, module, and most things set in .login
arushi: oh woops!
pfaendtner: a *lot* of issues come up when new versions of modules come in and people have old variables set in their .login
pfaendtner: we generally do fine though
pfaendtner: you can do it if you want, but people just need to understand all the lines in their file , keep it organized , and check their first if/when issues come up
pfaendtner: machine learning people: what do you think about training a molecular machine learning model that uses *energy* and *forces* ?  The force is just the negative gradient of the energy, so aren’t you including redundant information and weighing  certain regions of the PES more than others?
pfaendtner: caveat: I’m assuming the training data are sample on a uniform grid of spatial coordinates
sarahalamdari: Is anyone interested in presenting a poster at recruitment weekend? Victor is looking for a PRG :smile:
pfaendtner: Someone is interested, I guarantee it
pfaendtner: can someone research whether the virtual nanolab can be used free for academic now w/o license server?
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
arushi: Is that kayla , upper left?
chrisfu: i signed up and it said they will notify me in November if i got in...
ldgibson: Be careful not to learn too much github until then

wesleybeckner: pfaendtner can you imagine if this always had to be played while we ate chicken?
pfaendtner: Takeo Ischi: A lifter who truly loves chicken
arushi: Is sth wrong with hyak?.
arushi: nodestate, qstat, scp aren’t working!
kayla: working fine on login 2
kayla: are you on login1
kayla: try logging directly into login2
slackbot: Do, or do not. There is no try.
pfaendtner: one thing to try is “sudo rm -rf ./*” this normally fixes hyak for me
slackbot: Do, or do not. There is no try.
arushi: Jim’s trick worked! Thanks
luizoliveira: this wasn’t funny. Just deleted all my files in Hyak
kayla: ahhh!
luizoliveira: :troll:
kayla: hahaha
wesleybeckner: kayla
wesleybeckner: I ran ffmaker on login how do I stop it
wesleybeckner: :facepalm:
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
kayla: solved!
pfaendtner: Why no group meeting 2/28?
luizoliveira: you told me you would be busy or traveling that week
pfaendtner: lol - now I am worried I didn’t mark a trip on my calendar!! :slightly_smiling_face:
pfaendtner: ahhhh it got canceled - I remember now :slightly_smiling_face: no worries - we can skip or do something else - whatever you guys want
pfaendtner: at some point if the group wants I can give my lecture from UNICAMP last year , not sure if that is useful or not. Don’t ask me to do it just to flatter me :slightly_smiling_face:
pfaendtner: I think we should make some slack channels for research subtopics
pfaendtner: I”m going to make 
chrisfu: we still need to review the baron peters paper. would that be a good time to do it?
pfaendtner: mebbe - that is going to take a few weeks
pfaendtner: also created 
pfaendtner: My 60th paper is now under review! Awesome for the group. I was at 16 when I started at UW in September 2009 :scream: We are well on our way to 20 for the year!
coco: Forgot the group meeting:scream::scream::scream::scream:again....
pfaendtner: :angry:

ldgibson: the weekend where the department flies out potential PhD grad students to visit the campus where we convince them into coming to UW
maneki_neko: Easy, bring Boltzmann. People will join. :kissing:
slackbot: woof!
maneki_neko: Good luck &gt;u&lt;
luizoliveira: Is hyak down for everyone?
pfaendtner: sarahalamdari  you have no idea how interested this gruop is in doing posters
pfaendtner: I would like 2 posters: 1 on data science in PRG one one molecular science in PRG - we can brainstorm together to make Posters Great Again
luizoliveira: no info on their wiki
wesleybeckner: ill do one 80% data science 20% health and fittness
anotherjoshsmith: I'm going to protest the poster deal if we settle on the "make posters great again" slogan
wesleybeckner: i'm going to poster the protest if you protest the posters
pfaendtner: "COME JOIN PRG: WE TRAIN YOUR MIND AND BODY :poultry_leg::poultry_leg::poultry_leg:"
pfaendtner: PRG: WE MAKE YOUR BODY AND YOUR CV SUPER SWOLE 
maneki_neko: luizoliveira I was using HYAK this afternoon, like 2-4 PM
maneki_neko: Oh wait. No I was using Avogadro. Sorry.
luizoliveira: Thank you maneki_neko !
luizoliveira: it’s working now for me
coco: I can contribute my qspr part
arushi: Are we doing a group-contributed poster?
luizoliveira: gromacs people, aka those at B17 :wink:  what’s the memory you use to ask in you for your jobs?
arushi: 2gb to 22 gb
luizoliveira: Thanks Arushi.  I was using 30-40gb with cp2k, and just discovered that we have six 16 core 64 GB RAM nodes
luizoliveira: and one with 256 gb
arushi: woah. that's super cool
luizoliveira: also 
pfaendtner: no group meeting next week, we had the 28th free so I am moving A/C +1 wk
luizoliveira: do you have time next Tuesday during GM time window to give your Unicamp lecture? I think that would be really helpful
pfaendtner: sure
pfaendtner: please add it back on jrt cal :slightly_smiling_face:
luizoliveira: cool. maybe we can meet to discuss baron peters paper in the spring quarter. I guess you’ll be more available right?
pfaendtner: :thumbsup::skin-tone-4:
pfaendtner: wrote a python notebook to show linear regression, ridge and LASSO all in one shot! we are going to fly on Wednesday in DIRECT
coco: Where can I check the memory of nodes on hyak?
coco: Or do they share memory? How does this work? Need some cs education
arushi: Did y’all know that for a multiple walker metad, sum_hills with stride will generate number_of_replicas*expected_number_of_fes.dat file ?? :scream:
pfaendtner: There should be a master hills file tho. There are not individual bias potentials for each walker! 
wesleybeckner: me: are you a newspaper? 
linux machine: what?
me: because everyday with you it's a new issue
wesleybeckner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: thinking about disconnecting rss feed for research papers - does anyone use it?
arushi: Yeah! That's probably also eating up our chat history 
arushi: Good call 
wesleybeckner: has hyak connection been slow for others today?
luizoliveira: :snowflake:
luizoliveira: maybe
pfaendtner: Anyone interested in brainstorming with me (wild ideas welcome!) about a proposal I might throw together this weekend? Topics: petroleum, small molecule binding to surfaces, data science, machine learning
luizoliveira: organic or inorganic surfaces?
wesleybeckner: do have folks running MD with PBC=no ?
kayla: nevaaaa
chrisfu: i've done non-periodic, but not in Gromacs
daniel: is there something wrong on slack? can’t load or upload images..
ivancjr: i cant neither.
luizoliveira: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: wesleybeckner what is the problem w/nopbc in gro?
wesleybeckner: Think I may have it figured out. Can't have pme on

pfaendtner: that is 100% true! PME requires periodic
pfaendtner: _but the P in PME is not periodic_ it stands for *peanut*
wesleybeckner: as in salt peanut, salt peanut?
coco: I have a question… in plumed sum_hill  —idw  v1.....here the v1 is the one to be integrated or not?
chrisfu: this might answer your question: 
pfaendtner: : lets get after it and have an awesome Wednesday
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: Kelly is joining the slack team - she is the DIRECT program manager , supports the new grant for Hyak accelerator nodes , and manages my calendar - you may hear from her occasionally about schedule changes
kellythornton: kellythornton has joined the channel
wesleybeckner: luizoliveira if poss could you free up some nodes?
coco: I tried -dt and -timestep in trjconv .... but non of them worked
coco: :cry:
luizoliveira: :dancingbanana:
luizoliveira: sorry guys. maybe in few hours. Almost done with my night shift
luizoliveira: - - coco
slackbot: coo coo for cocoa puffs!!!
luizoliveira: - - dt ( usually two hyphens, I guess)
anotherjoshsmith: No double dash with gmx commands
luizoliveira: I thought she was talking about plumed
anotherjoshsmith: trjconv in gmx to shorten trajectory. using -skip should work just as well
kayla: luizoliveira , can you give us an estimate of when your jobs will finish today?
arushi: I can put some runs on backfill
luizoliveira: almost there guys almost there,
luizoliveira: please bear with me.
luizoliveira: pao de queijo will be available next week at B49
kayla: no problemo! just looking for an estimate of when the nodes will be free!
luizoliveira: there are going to be done in two weeks kayla
luizoliveira: maximum
luizoliveira: :troll:
luizoliveira: this morning
kayla: hahah
pfaendtner: luizs jobs are #1 priority right now
pfaendtner: sorry - this is a really important project
pfaendtner: thanks everyone for being good @ sharing
arushi: it’s unreal
kejiawu: LOL who's everyone in this pic
anotherjoshsmith: haha each person in the front row is obviously photoshopped in, hard to tell with the others
kejiawu: omg
kejiawu: can we put luiz there?
wesleybeckner: how do you use gaussian?
wesleybeckner: <missing_message>
chrisfu: literally ask myself this everyday
maneki_neko: Can we start a support group?
maneki_neko: :joy: 
wesleybeckner: you mean gaussian anonymous? Hi everyone, my name is Wesley, I'm a gausaholic
wesleybeckner: maneki_neko talk to pfaendtner about forming a committee for spring quarter
daniel: working group for gaussian in spring?
maneki_neko: Gaussian is so passive agressive :sweat:
ldgibson: pretty sure we need a working group to organize all the working groups next quarter
daniel: storage of google drive using uw account is unlimited? and even after graduation?
arushi: Yaa
arushi: Account doesn't expire after graduation I think 
anotherjoshsmith: Unlimited. That's tiiight. 
pfaendtner: cloud storage working group
ldgibson: Do we know who will be presenting for recruitment weekend? Victor is wondering 
chrisfu: We are right now 757GB over quota  (suppscr) and have 3-4 days to get back under
arushi: Wow
arushi: Move stuff to office Mac or Google drive ? 
pfaendtner: can I get the list of who is using all the space?
wesleybeckner: im cleaning some stuff up rn atm
pfaendtner: are the B17 people coming?
pfaendtner: in a month someone please remind me to schedule the rosetta peptide tutorial...

luizoliveira: and Vance
pfaendtner: :thumbsup::skin-tone-4:
pfaendtner:  Kayla or Josh needs some nodes for a time sensitive project - if they ask you to clear jobs please consider the request coming from me
wesleybeckner: #namethatsweetjam!

How can you see into my eyes, like open doors
Leading you down into my core 
Where I've become so numb, 
Without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold 
Until you find it there and lead it back 
Home
kayla: Evanescene
kayla: ooops, Evanescence
kayla: I went through a big Evanescence phase haha
pfaendtner: I was thinking of different type of Sweet Jam like strawberry :strawberry:
maneki_neko: I prefer rhubarb
arushi: Anything new on the quota front? Are we in the clear?
chrisfu: Clear
pfaendtner: "Satisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment, full effort is full victory" - Gandhi

luizoliveira: :slightly_frowning_face:
anotherjoshsmith: Haha superlatives are so tempting
pfaendtner: those are two awesome ChemE profs!
luizoliveira: oh serious? I’m sure you all will like my next sentences. ChemE are everywhere
pfaendtner: Smells like someone was seriously blazing on 3rd flr
houghb: :herb: talk in all the channels today, even on different UW slack teams!  Must be something in the air
anotherjoshsmith: Sorry had to take a quick break from this stressful writing experience and popped up there to chief with the Jiang lab
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: PRGs gonna blaze
pfaendtner: maybe we should change our grad recruiting strategy
pfaendtner: the “City Tour” can include some specific stops
coco: My toilet flooded my house.. two floors are soaked....they are going to dry my house and tear down all the wallpapers to check the structure :weary::weary::weary:
kayla: Oh no coco!!! I'm so sorry! :( 
slackbot: coo coo for cocoa puffs!!!
coco: I don't know it could be so bad :weary::weary:
arushi: So sorry to hear that!!
maneki_neko: Ahhhhhhh. That's horrible!! :-1::cry: 
pfaendtner: Argh sorry!! do you have damage to your personal belongings? Everyone should consider renters insurance for something like this if they don’t have it
coco: Water went down from vent directly. Our stuff are all fine the only damage is the wall:worried:
coco: We are considering to get an insurance now
coco: We are going to talk to contractors right now so probably won't come to office today :cry: 
pfaendtner: the insurance is very cheap - only like $15 , sorry about the trouble coco!
slackbot: coo coo for cocoa puffs!!!
coco: Thank you guys
wesleybeckner: when is group meeting next quarter
luizoliveira: That’s a good question. coco did you asked around to see if other people are available in the days you don’t have class?
slackbot: coo coo for cocoa puffs!!!
coco: nope:flushed: I can collect everybodies’ schedule and figure out
luizoliveira: ok thanks!
coco: Can we do Tuesday afternoon? or Monday morning?
luizoliveira: I’m ok with both. Bu prefer Monday morning (at 9?), though.
coco: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: coco luizoliveira please ask kellythornton which days work for me in general next Q? I prefer Mon AM or anytime Tue or Wed , grad students often don’t like Mon AM for group meeting tho
slackbot: coo coo for cocoa puffs!!!
coco: Wed Morning looks promising
luizoliveira:  Wed at 9? If someone isn’t ok let me know by today
pfaendtner: Wed 9-10:30 is fine, the Nance lab comes in @ 10:30
pfaendtner: We will start at 9 sharp and my expectation is people will not roll in late and be disruptive
slackbot: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: Wed 29 is no-go for me, so 4/5
pfaendtner: Kelly will be in charge of adding JRT weekly from now on - I have a bit of time on Friday if people have things to discuss.  I am on travel next week
pfaendtner: Reminder: if you need to see me and you can’t find me, ask kellythornton or pfaendtner for more time!
pfaendtner: I will be emailing grads and luiz about research status updates and research plans
kejiawu: I'm so sorry that I may miss today's group meeting... I feel bad this morning:disappointed: sorry Sarah and Luke.
ldgibson: No worries, feel better! 
sarahalamdari: Feel better keja!!
luizoliveira:  for those who didn’t vote for Monday morning we changed that because we realized that Wed at 9 was too early (I didn’t explained that on my email, we can’t start at 9:30 there is a meeting starting at 10:30 in B109) as many arrive late even with our meeting starting at 9:30. I understand that there are still problems with Monday morning. And I chose that for democratic reasons (it was the second most voted on the poll). We can make a second pool between the second and third places (Monday morning and Thursday morning). kellythornton is Jim available on Thursday mornings? ( if Thursday morning wins we still need to check if B109 is available or not, we already have it booked for Monday mornings)
anotherjoshsmith: Shaoyi's group normally does 8:30 Thursday mornings
arushi: 8:30 am :scream:
luizoliveira: anotherjoshsmith and is this one of your sub-group in Shaoyi’s group?
luizoliveira: I mean you have to attend that meeting on Thursday morning?
kellythornton: Hello, Jim is not available on Thursdays. Mondays would be better
slackbot: Probably getting swole at crossfit! :mindbender:
luizoliveira: anyway B109 will not be available
luizoliveira: ok. Thanks Kelly!
luizoliveira:  solved! We keep Monday morning with its imperfections
luizoliveira: Let’s be on time on spring guys!
luizoliveira: Think about our fellows in Shaoyi’s group and don’t hit the snooze button
pfaendtner: We should one-up the Jiangs and finish group meeting at 8:30 Thur AM! Imagine their surprise when we walk out the door smart, fresh and ready to tackle Thursday. 
anotherjoshsmith: Not sure how many of us would be looking fresh in that scenario :sweat_smile:
ldgibson: are we not allowed to change the colors of directories and such on hyak?
arushi: colors?? :open_mouth:
ldgibson: Yeah, all of my directories are colored blue when I type ls, but I was gonna see if I could change it, but it doesn’t take
arushi: oh, I think that’s the color scheme.
ldgibson: Yeah, I can change it on my machine, but the same command doesn’t work on hyak
luizoliveira: I think this will do the job: 
if [ -x /usr/bin/dircolors ]; then
     test -r ~/.dircolors &amp;&amp; eval "$(dircolors -b ~/.dircolors)" || eval "$(dircolors -b)"
      alias ls='ls --color=auto'
      alias dir='dir --color=auto'
      alias vdir='vdir --color=auto'

wesleybeckner: is rainbow an option?
wesleybeckner: or amethyst?
kayla: Haha

arushi: Y’all should come and visit PRG posters TODAY for the DIRECT class from 3-5 pm at the Data Science Studio! 

Coco, Kejia, Wes, Daniel, Garrett, Khushmeen, and I will be presenting!
slackbot: coo coo for cocoa puffs!!!
anotherjoshsmith: Can someone point me in the direction of an hydroxyapatite surface (pdb or otherwise) on hyak?
arushi: kayla

anotherjoshsmith:  Organizing the crash course on statistical learning for next term, and hoping to gauge interest. We will be working through one chapter a week of Intro to Statistical Learning. The format will be one hour of lecture followed by an hour of getting our hands dirty with ML coding excercises/projects. Jim is willing to commit to these two hours, so it is essential that you are prepared for the meeting every week. This will be an excellent opportunity to solidify your grasp on elementary ML concepts, essential for aspiring data scientists. Please give me a thumbs up if you'd like to participate!
slackbot: Probably getting swole at crossfit! :mindbender:
anotherjoshsmith: Wicked... working on the details now. Please DM me with times that don't work if you have class.
anotherjoshsmith: Looking like W 9:30-11:30. If you find that objectionable speak now or forever hold your peace!

kayla: wow.
pfaendtner: pry cool - one of you gets a minor accomplishment and then the whole group takes the whole afternoon off :angry:
pfaendtner: goodbye research papers channel
pfaendtner:  I am getting increased requests for new undergrad researchers to join the group this summer or next year. I am open to this if you want to mentor a student, but I will not be involved this summer or next year so I can focus on grants, existing group, and swolebattical.  So if you want to do it, you are committing to creating a project and mentoring a new student.  Let me know asap if you are interested
luizoliveira: I am. Are any of them interested in heterocatalysis?
maneki_neko: Luiz why do you want to do heterocatalysis so much? :slightly_smiling_face: 
pfaendtner: probably they are interested in any research experience :slightly_smiling_face: :slightly_smiling_face: I will wait to hear from anyone else then send them a note with people to contact, etc.. .
daniel: rookie question: does VMD have something like undo and redo?
wesleybeckner: ya just type rm -rf ./* in another terminal window
pfaendtner: lol do not do that
daniel: cool I will try and tell you what happen
pfaendtner: _unless you add sudo rm -rf ./* _
pfaendtner: ok just to be clear do not do that under any circumstances
daniel: I just tried and found that it redo whole computer! amazing
wesleybeckner: haha
coco: It’s shame that april fool is on Saturday…
coco: Or it would be fun in PRG:thinking_face:

sarahalamdari: anyone want a thunderbolt mini port to HDMI/VGA/DVI I impulse bought the wrong adaptor :facepalm:
pfaendtner: In dongle hell you always have the wrong adapter 
sarahalamdari: I considered getting an adapter for my adapter, but ldgibson wouldn't let me
pfaendtner: The road to dongle hell is paved with adapters for adapters  
wesleybeckner: I've gotta stay near a toilet today guys but I should be on slack if you need me
chrisfu: we are ~1 TB over quota for suppscr memory with 6 days to get under quota and have ~1.5TB before we hit the hard cap

luizoliveira: arushi and everyone if you wanna have some pao de queijo, just come to B49
arushi: luizoliveira : yummy as always
luizoliveira: Hi kellythornton. Are we going to have JRTs this week?
kellythornton: No JRT this week, Jim is out traveling and booked up for most of the week.
slackbot: Probably getting swole at crossfit! :mindbender:
pfaendtner: thanks slackbot
pfaendtner: _although it was leg day today: front squat and deadlift_
kellythornton: Ha! Ok, I will add JRT time for next week by the end of the day
pfaendtner: Kelly, do you see how they treat me?! I get no respect
kellythornton: Just brutal :slightly_smiling_face:
pfaendtner: I cleaned 15 TB from archive
arushi: pfaendtner : Who is presenting next week in group meeting? Kayla/Luiz? Chris/Arushi?
pfaendtner: everything just got bumped back
pfaendtner: unless we have a need for people to go @ a certain time - I would prefer LK next week
pfaendtner: Luiz Kayla - like LK peptide
daniel: Does anyone use `rsync` instead of scp? I found it has more options, like `rsync -a --exclude *.xtc` coping a folder but excluding .xtc file in it.
daniel: typo `--exclude=*.xtc`
daniel: and the most important is it’s much much much faster than scp
coco: you guys from B49 want to come and say hi to the big buddy?
luizoliveira:  have a look on the group calendar. I’ve made changes
tunyia2: Has anyone had problems opening gnuplot and vmd on hyak alone? It opens fine on my local system but not on hyak?
tunyia2: Nevermind figured it out; had too many files open on my laptop
houghb: How do folks feel about the march for science this weekend?
arushi: On a visa, so (I feel) I can't risk being involved. Have been reading conflicting views about the march.
houghb: Me too - I am not sure where I'll land on the conflicting views issue because I relate to both sides.  I'm not too happy that the most prominent speakers at the march are [liberal] politicians though (instead of scientists); seems like they can't avoid it becoming political when that is the case...  If it was being sold as a political anti-Trump march that would almost be easier to get behind...
anotherjoshsmith: The real travesty is that we're forced to work on a state holiday. I'd march against that! ...but then get distracted and pick up some snacks from 7/11
pfaendtner: I was all fired up about the march for science - but my aunt and uncle are coming over for dinner so WTH, I’ll just make their damn barbacoa and call it good.
pfaendtner: We should do a PRG march for funding so that everyone can eat next year
coco: A march like this :splits::splits::splits:P:splits:R:splits:G:splits::splits::splits:
luizoliveira:  I’m updating the group web site, were there any new papers and awards during this month? I’m aware of Kayla’s awards only.
kayla: I have a new paper in press:

pfaendtner: I will work on yenenehs files this week
wesleybeckner: Josh and I are on the calendar to give group meeting on memorial day, is that right?
pfaendtner: that is a federal holiday, there is no group meeting that day
luizoliveira: already changed my bad
coco: These totally doesn’t make sense.. So I think we should not mess up with stride… and stride should match replex..
coco: BTW the x axis is time (ps)
coco: Amazed by that in stride = 1  there’s a peak at 0.2ps which is 100 step..
pfaendtner: Something is goofy here. We should meet to work on it 
pfaendtner: Here is some info from Greg Voth: 


This paper describes very exciting coarse-grained simulations of the HIV virus capsid formation. I think it also illustrate the range of what can be done with coarse-graining:
 
J. M. A. Grime, J. F. Dama, B. K. Ganser-Pornillos, C. L. Woodward, G. J. Jensen, M. Yeager, G. A. Voth, “Coarse-grained Simulation Reveals Key Features of HIV-1 Capsid Self-Assembly”, Nature Comm. 7, 11568(1-11) (2016). DOI: 10.1038/ncomms11568; PMCID: PMC4869257 

 
 
This paper describes the very important issue of “representability” in CG models, something we feel is being overlooked in many studies and is quite essential to consider. We are soon to submit a follow-up on a method to overcome this problem:
 
J. W. Wagner,* J. F. Dama,* A. E. P. Durumeric, and G. A. Voth, “On the Representability Problem and the Physical Meaning of Coarse-Grained Models”, J. Chem. Phys. 145, 044108(1-12) (2016). (*Authors contributed equally)  
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27475349>
 
 
This paper describes a version of our “ultra-coarse-grained” models in which the CG “beads” can have internal “states”. This UCG approach is allowing us to accurately simulate problems with a CG model that we never before thought would be possible (e.g., interfaces, solvophobic effects, etc), including at the high resolution CG level:
 
J. F. Dama, J. Jin, and G. A. Voth, “The Theory of Ultra-Coarse-Graining. 3. Coarse-grained Sites with Rapid Local Equilibrium of Internal States”, J. Chem. Theory Comp. 13, 1010–1022 (2017). 
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28112956>
 
 
This paper described methods to rapidly develop very highly coarse-grained models of transmembrane proteins, which may be valuable to some of you:
 
J. J. Madsen, A. V. Sinitskiy, J. Li, and G. A. Voth, “Highly Coarse-grained Representations of Transmembrane Proteins”, J. Chem. Theory Comp. 13, 935−944 (2017). PMCID: PMC5312841 
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28043122>
 
 
I could not resist sending this somewhat older paper in which our CG methods have been applied to Feynman path integrals at equilibrium. The resulting outcome is fascinating, in my view, and summarized in Fig. 2:
 
A. V. Sinitskiy and G. A. Voth, “A Reductionist Perspective on Quantum Statistical Mechanics: Coarse-Graining of Path Integrals”, J. Chem. Phys. 143, 094104(1-10) (2015).  
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26342356>
 
 
This paper shows how to blend maximum entropy with ab initio MD to minimally bias an AIMD ensemble with experimental data. The resulting outcome for the more effective and accurate AIMD simulation of liquid water and an excess proton in water (plus the new insights) is quite encouraging. I hope you like it (and use it!):

coco: When we use pip install --user on hyak does it stay when we log out?
chrisfu: it should
luizoliveira: did someone take my adapter on my table?
sarahalamdari: kejiawu
luizoliveira: thanks
sarahalamdari: I think I accidentally locked her out before she could give it back, sorry!
kejiawu: LOL oh sorry its on my desk! I meant to ask Coco to return it for me but I forgot:joy: and I'm downtown in meeting so...
kejiawu: sorry Luiz!
coco: I had a class in morning was not able to return it :joy::joy:
arushi: Fell into this article while looking for “free energy stuff”


It’s interesting … brains, fish, and surprises (=entropy) !
anotherjoshsmith: You fell in? Have you found your way out? Do you need help?
coco: God this paper is like philosophy..
coco: Recently I feel this whole world is simply statistics…
kejiawu: BUILD A MODEL FOR THE WORLD
coco: And there are huge energy barriers i need to climb!
coco: I don’t know why there are a bunch of nodes available right now but I am waiting in line….:weary:
pfaendtner:  chance wants mox filled up. Run lots of backfill jobs too!!
pfaendtner: They need to see how hot the data center is getting 
coco: resonable! bf all come from this guy “jsnijder”
coco: who has 200 jobs running…
pfaendtner: Also. Someone please remind me to have a discussion about node use and strategy at upcoming group meeting. I am hearing some strange things :) 
luizoliveira: is mox available to everyone to run bf jobs or just to students?
arushi: Sorry PRGs, I am unwell and won't be in the office today :thermometer: 
anotherjoshsmith: NOOOOOO!!!
luizoliveira: hope you get better soon Arushi.
wesleybeckner: :disappointed:
ksakloth: take care !
pfaendtner: Ru take care!!!
pfaendtner: I just found my folder of group meetings from grad school!!! this is amazing
pfaendtner: here are some slides from my talks
pfaendtner: you guys - I was batshit crazy in grad school
pfaendtner: this was my intro slide to my group meeting from 7/22/205
coco: hahahahahaha!!!
ldgibson: I was gonna ask this at the end of my group presentation, but what does everyone use for quick and easy image editing on Mac (similar to MS Paint)?
wesleybeckner: gimp
wesleybeckner: inkscape
wesleybeckner: kidpix
ldgibson: which is your fav, cuz I tried inkscape and didn’t fall _in love_
kayla: gimp
kayla: inkscape
coco: are they all free?
ldgibson: gimp and inkscape are
ldgibson: dunno about kidpix
ldgibson: how awkward, I forgot what kidpix was and thought wes was serious
pfaendtner: You should use inkscape for page layout and gimp for image editing
pfaendtner: anyone try the new Duo 2 factor authentication yet? it is awesome
pfaendtner: My eToken is done!!!
sarahalamdari: ITS AWESOME :dancingbanana:
wesleybeckner: I'm so ready to not have this eToken
kejiawu: so we don't have JRT this week right?
pfaendtner: I can login to Hyak w/my Apple Watch!!
kayla: high techhhh
kayla: that’s cool!
luizoliveira:  does someone need a microwave?
maneki_neko: Uhhhh
wesleybeckner: NO KAYLA DID NOT SEND YOU SOMETHING
wesleybeckner: ARUSHI NOOOOOO
arushi: why is giphy NSFW
luizoliveira: haha
luizoliveira: maybe it was bad 
anotherjoshsmith: I read the google doc. It's very informative, everyone should open
caitwolf:  If anyone wants me to mail back their old entrust token to IT for recycling/disposal/whatever they do with them, just let me know or drop it off at my desk (room B9) today or tomorrow once you switch over to Duo. I can send them all back in one big envelope. While chrisfu may have volunteered me for this...I am now taking credit haha
kayla: I fell for that :disappointed:
kayla: Boo
kayla: Darn hufflepuffs
houghb: kayla, make sure you revoke the permissions you gave it if you haven't already
kayla: what does that mean
houghb: from the comments on that article:
"It’s not that this is some “website that looks like google” and is “duplicating the google sign-in page”. It’s an actual Google Doc app, that you have to give permission to access your account details. That’s what makes it so dangerous, that it’s acting as a normal app would, requiring normal google authentication and authorization. It doesn’t gain access to your credentials, but the permissions it requests gives it access to a hell of a lot of stuff in your account. You have to revoke the app permissions at  if you gave it access. People are saying on twitter “change your password”, but that won’t revoke access, you have to actively revoke access to disconnect the malicious app from your account."
arushi: ya, tell us houghb
houghb: so go to that link (while logged in to your google account), and revoke those permissions - I don't know what the app is called, but if there's anything in there that you don't recognize I would just revoke them
kayla: what link?
arushi: <missing_message>
kayla: thanks
kayla: thanks blake!
houghb: :+1:
coco: Anyone had the problem of not able to open vmd after switching to duo?
coco: `/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.OfQXnZbipf/org.macosforge.xquartz: unknown host. (nodename nor servname provided, or not known)`
coco: Any one has switched and tried vmd or gnuplot after that?
ldgibson: Lemme check my files, I may already have that 
pfaendtner: OK 3 things:
1) The fact you remembered to get Flash the bassett hound is great
2) I think the most realistic Luke is Cooter (2nd from right), but Bo is not bad either.  Uncle Jesse is just ridiculous 
3) Sarah needs to goto photoshop class “Big League”
wesleybeckner: Lollll
anotherjoshsmith: coco I'm also having issues with VMD and gnuplot now. Still on eToken
coco: You can switch back?
chrisfu: is the printer in B17 usable?
kayla: Yes if you take the time to set it up! Please doooo! 
pfaendtner: Congrats to arushi and also to tunyia2 !!!!
coco: I'll be 10 mins late please start without me :cry:
coco: :cry::cry::cry::joy::cry::cry:
daniel: I think I didn’t do the way I wanted to in group meeting. I could do better :fearful: :fearful: :fearful: Anyway, here is the Jupyter notebook, I can take any questions if you are interested. 
kejiawu: You did it pretty good:+1:
luizoliveira: man, you did a great job, I liked the puzzles very much!
luizoliveira:  group meeting next week will be Tuesday (2:30-4)
daniel: PRG is warm:scream::scream::scream:
ksakloth: Yes daniel you did well!
luizoliveira: 2 “computational” seminars (today and next monday), that could be of interest to some of us. I don’t have access to the abstracts, though: 
coco: Here is the abstract
coco: “Watching the Dance of Electrons in Molecules and Materials”

Time-dependent electronic structure theory is a unique tool to investigate ultrafast non-equilibrium chemical processes. In this talk, I will illustrate the power of quantum electron dynamics by presenting several applications that are important in molecular and materials sciences. In the first part of the talk, I present our recent studies on (1) the formation, transfer and collapse of molecular plasmon in a silver nanowire, and (2) the time-dependent characteristics and spectroscopic consequences of the polaron pair formation in an oligomer of seven thiophene units. In the second part of the talk, I focus on introducing new applications enabled by our recent development of electron spin dynamics, including the formation of spin wave.

For more information about Professor Li please visit his research group website .

pfaendtner:  no group meeting this afternoon - we need to reschedule because someone is ill and I want all 3 to present together. I will schedule another time next week
gdavids3:  I made banana bread for group meeting, but since it isnt happening, I brought it in today. It’s in B17. Please come eat some!! (There are walnuts in it)
maneki_neko: :cry: 
maneki_neko: Boo 🤤
kayla: I can verify it is DELICIOUS.
maneki_neko: 🤤:sweat::unamused:
wesleybeckner: <missing_message>
wesleybeckner: is it that delicious ^^ ?
maneki_neko: I'll just make my own banana bread. Here in Bellevue.
kayla: That is so creepy.
coco: Save some for me pleeeeeeease 
gdavids3: there is so much
kayla: I may eat it all before you get here Coco, so hurryyy
coco: :crying_cat_face::crying_cat_face::crying_cat_face:
kayla: jk there is a lot left
gdavids3:  We are moving the postponed group meeting to next Wednesday from 9:30 to 11am ... The same time that the stats class was and will be stealing the room that we had for it.
arushi: 

Looks interesting!
pfaendtner:  anyone planning to work late tomorrow night? wondering if someone would be interested in babysitting boltzmann in B17 from 5:45 to about 8-8:30. Academic grandmother Linda Broadbelt is here tmrw, would like to meet him very much, but we have a dept. dinner to goto so he needs to go somewhere :slightly_smiling_face: :slightly_smiling_face:

coco: We took elevator and missed you guys :cold_sweat:
coco: Where are we going?
anotherjoshsmith: Pioneer square stop
anotherjoshsmith: Flat stick pub
coco: Are we on the same link?  Have you left UW stop
coco: Nice 
coco: Thx!
arushi: We are at the stop
arushi: Last cabin 
coco: :smile::smile:
chrisfu: On mox, I have compiled the following codes(versions): GROMACS(5.1.2, 5.1.4, 2016.3), Amber14 (AmberTools14), and PLUMED (2.0, 2.4dev [compiled last July and i source on ikt], 2.3.0, 2.3.1). PLUMED libraries ar dynamically linked to the MD codes you should be able to link whichever PLUMED you want with whichever MD code you choose to use (with some exceptions). Outside of CP2K are there any codes or programs I am missing??
pfaendtner: Did u compile these codes at Flatstick?!
chrisfu: where else would you compile codes?
anotherjoshsmith: Thank you all for humoring me with the journey to Flatstick, hope everyone had fun!
luizoliveira:  The Nance group has invited us to a happy hour on June 1 around 7 pm at Kate’s Pub
slackbot: :beer: *slurp* *burp* ヾ(o✪‿✪o)ｼ
arushi: <missing_message>
anotherjoshsmith: Talked with Rick from Nance's group, and we're gonna reschedule tonight's happy hour because of conflicts with a few other events on and around campus

arushi: Or till RGB opens up!
anotherjoshsmith: Yeah RGB will be sweeet. Stop by Husky Sunset instead for drinks that you can drink for $0. 5:30-8:30 in Sylvan Grove... although I trust you won't show up before 7:15 because WORK
kejiawu: Haha that's true!
wesleybeckner: hahah
wesleybeckner: am i the only one out of the loop on RGB?
wesleybeckner: CMYK?
wesleybeckner: hex?
kejiawu: probably yes
arushi: Rachel’s Ginger beerrrr
sarahalamdari: :heart_eyes:
arushi: that too at UVillage
kayla: Rachel’s Ginger Beeeeer!
arushi: 

LOL?
wesleybeckner: can anyone free up one node?
wesleybeckner: nvm
kayla: did you get one?
wesleybeckner: one of my jobs finished and so now i have one
kayla: got it
luizoliveira:  just confirming that we’re going to have group meeting Monday morning.
coco: The mother duck has left and there were two duckling left near the fountain.. a crow came and took one away 
coco: Now we don't know what to do 
coco: We just scared the crows away
coco: We call the rehabilitation and this other girl here will take him to the rehabilitation 
kejiawu: Good job coco!
coco: well..the right thing to do is not to touch the baby bird and keep the predator away.. but we don’t have all day..
kejiawu: the right thing is always trying to do something
kejiawu: :wink::muscle:
coco: I think the duckling last year didnt survive at all…
kejiawu: it will. and you already tried to help and the rest is its own destiny
coco: could have roasted it…
coco: yummmm
kejiawu: :facepalm:
pfaendtner: Maybe the crow took the duck to its own nest to make it part of the family
wesleybeckner: In case word hasn't gotten around Miwa (or as she prefers-Miwaka flaka flame) will be joining us this summer via the Clean Energy Bridge to Research REU, yayyyy Miwa! 

I'll send a reminder out about this later but there is a Summer STEM Welcome BBQ on June 22 at 5 pm at Warren G. Magnuson park that everyone is welcome to attend (meet other REU students, talk to them about how awesome research is, eat free food, maybe jump in the lake) :ok_hand: 

:dancingbanana:
slackbot: Miwaka Floka Flame!
wesleybeckner: wow, slackbot quick to catch on!
maneki_neko: Crows pick up ducklings??!
maneki_neko: There's also a lunch on the 18th for my internship but I think only Jim is invited :joy::joy::joy: Idk if "mentor lunch" means only Jim
ldgibson: Would anyone be interested in meeting with Dr. Marian Hettiaratchi this coming Monday for 25 minutes? She is the first DYSS speaker and her research focuses on improving drug delivery strategies for tissue repair by using natural and engineered affinities between proteins and biomaterials.
pfaendtner: If she can help deliver a dime bag to my front porch I am in :smoking:
coco: :scream_cat::scream_cat::scream_cat::scream_cat:
pfaendtner: ^^ I see this meeting @ 2pm, this is not for me, right? just checking
ldgibson: Oh, no, it's open to whomever wants to join though
kejiawu: Hi friends! Jim will have an one-hour meeting with Chris and me to talk about using Infrequent MetaD to calculate kon and koff. As Jim said, "Coco, Arushi, Kayla should definitely come. But anyone is invited."^^^
kejiawu: And it's next Monday 6/19, 3-4pm in MolES 2nd floor conference room!
wesleybeckner: I went to 109. On my way!
kayla: Ikt is BACKKKKK!
kayla: finally
arushi: yay!
kejiawu: I'm so sorry but I seems highly allergic/kinda poisoned by some things I don't even know...:facepalm: probably can't make it today. Sorry Jim, Kalya and Arushi!
pfaendtner: take care and feel better soon!
ldgibson:  would anyone in the group like to meet with Chris Bahl this Monday? He’s the next DYSS speaker and was the chosen applicant within UW. He is currently a postdoc in the Baker lab and does some computational work (probably on protein design).
maneki_neko: He sounds cool
maneki_neko: I'll go
coco: +1
coco: This Monday?
ldgibson: yeah
ldgibson: I’ll see what time is available
slackbot: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: ldgibson , he sounds like a total Bahler
maneki_neko: Why did slackbot respond with this peanut thing??
kayla: Because Luke said "time"! 
maneki_neko:  Is anyone else interested in taking a tour of HYAK? As in the actual computer where it is stored and stuff? I'm setting up a tour right now.
ldgibson: that sounds kind of interesting, when is it at?
maneki_neko: Sometime this month - I'm in the process of setting it up.
maneki_neko: Are there any dates that wouldn't work for you?
ldgibson: as far as I know right now, I don’t think so
coco: want to go
maneki_neko: ok thanks coco!
maneki_neko: ldgibson coco Could you fill this out really quick for the tour? 
maneki_neko: They need an official head count and such
coco: Thank you miwa
slackbot: Miwaka Floka Flame!
ldgibson: all done!
maneki_neko: Welcome welcome.
pfaendtner:  missed my bus. Can we please start group meeting at 9:45 instead. Sorry! 
luizoliveira: :thumbsup_all:
ldgibson:  we are meeting with Chris Bahl at 2:00 pm over here in B49 for all that are interested, he is the DYSS speaker today and currently works in the Baker lab doing protein design
maneki_neko: Ok!
maneki_neko:  I'm giving a quick presentation 11:00-11:20 ish this Friday (the 14th) in MolES 115 to my internship group explaining what our lab does. If anyone wants to join and talk really quickly about what they do that would be appreciated. ^^ It's just Chris and me right now. I'll bring snaaacks. :+1:
coco: :the_horns::skin-tone-2:
luizoliveira:  Please look for changes in the calendar. No group meetings on 07/24. We can have a Journal Club. 
luizoliveira:  I'm preparing to apply for faculty positions and it would be very helpful if you could give me a feedback on the three projects I'll have on my research statement. I'm willing to present them next Monday during group meeting time. Could you reply with a thumbs up in case you can attend it?
luizoliveira: Thank you very much guys!
coco: luizoliveira Hi Luiz, I am not feeling well this morning and can't come to the group meeting I am so sorry 
daniel: new mac os update fixes the jupyter notebook browser bug
kejiawu: wow!!
kejiawu: finally!
daniel: it’s too late
daniel: to apologize, it’s too late~
kejiawu: :facepalm::thinking_face:
luizoliveira: thank you for letting me know coco No problem, I will, for sure, rehearsal it many times and would need audience. I let you know the next time. :wink:. Hope you get better soon. Everyone ( ) thank you very much for the detailed feedback and for your time!!
maneki_neko: Does anyone know how to block indent in a paragraph in ipython notebook?
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: ^ my slide deck from today
pfaendtner:  - please review 
<https://plumed.github.io/doc-master/user-doc/html/trieste-2.html>

there is a nice block averaging procedure for assessing error in your FES! This is an excellent convergence metric. I would like some of you to investigate this for your work.  

Essential reading for block averaging:  <http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.457480>

^ this classic paper would make a great group meeting presentation
pfaendtner: Interesting paper I just saw some results on  
luizoliveira chrisfu ldgibson sarahalamdari
kejiawu: Did anyone have problems with logging in hyak since yesterday?:cry:
kejiawu: Like this. And even if i can log in it occasionally, everything looks different there.. and can't do gmx/vmd anymore:facepalm:
sarahalamdari: yes! try logging into ikt2
kejiawu: Wow how to do that!
kejiawu: ;)
sarahalamdari: I think its 
kejiawu: Coolll! Thank you Sarah!
kejiawu: Ohh. It doesn't work for me tho lol
luizoliveira: have a look on your  ~/.ssh/known_hosts (on your local machine)
kejiawu: Thanks Luiz, but what should i find in that file?
kejiawu: Ah still can't access hyak. i think i need to email uw-it soon orz
ldgibson: I have a meeting with Dr. Nav Nidhi Rajput, the DYSS speaker, today from 2:00-2:25 (after the open session of Kayla’s defense). She is the only computational speaker for the series this summer and she focuses on predicting and understanding physical properties of liquid solutions, nanoporous materials, and confined fluids for applications in batteries using MD and ab initio methods. Should be a great meeting for everyone, especially those interested in batteries wesleybeckner coco maneki_neko
maneki_neko: That sounds really cool! Thanks for letting me know. I'll be there. :smile:
pfaendtner:  good dyss seminar about simulations today!!
luizoliveira:  from next week on we will be back to 109 for our group meetings.
pfaendtner:  Taking the group to celebrate Kayla PhD tomorrow! DTF at U Village.  kayla what time are we leaving, are we taking a bus?
slackbot: <missing_message>
kayla: It opens at 11 am, so I thought we could be there around then to ensure we get a table? I'll call ahead of course, but is that too soon for everyone? 
kayla: People can either bus (75, 372) or walk! It is a 15-20 minute walk. 
arushi: DTF :raising_hand::skin-tone-4: :heart:
luizoliveira: DFT? ( sorry I couldn’t resist)
kejiawu: :laughing:
coco: DFT+1
kejiawu: we can go to DTF to talk about DFT altogether
anotherjoshsmith: HF
maneki_neko: NOM
arushi: 

This is a longish article but SUCH AN INTERESTING READ for me!!
anotherjoshsmith: Chaperone proteins are fake news
arushi: say whaaat
anotherjoshsmith: :trump: 
wesleybeckner: :trump:
maneki_neko: Are we still going to Din Tai Fung? I've been here for an hour almost. :sweat:
coco: Where are you miwa 
coco: maneki_neko 
maneki_neko: I'm here...
coco: We are in university village

maneki_neko: Yes I'm in University Village
wesleybeckner: :facepalm:
coco: I am late for a few minstrels 
arushi: It's in B109 coco
wesleybeckner: Hey guys something hit me this morning. I think just food related. I tried my best to rally but feel extremely nauseous :( I'll be out the rest of today 
kejiawu: take care!
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
coco: Can I invite a friend to group meeting tomorrow?
pfaendtner: y not?
pfaendtner: are they nicE?
coco: I think so:thinking_face:
anotherjoshsmith: Forgot to mention... practical impact of the switch from pd.DataFrame to np.ndarray was decreasing the run time in production from 20 minutes to 7 seconds
maneki_neko:  I'm giving a poster session tomorrow in Mary Gates Hall 9:00-10:30 if any of you wanna stop by. :sunglasses: 
pfaendtner: Please stop by and see Miwas poster and talk to some other of our great undergrads summer researchers! 
wesleybeckner: :clap: 
wesleybeckner: Still about 45 minutes left of the symposium. Very cool to see other projects around campus!
maneki_neko: Thanks everyone for visiting my poster session!
kayla: I'm sad I couldn't be there Miwa! I'm sure you did great! :) 
slackbot: Miwaka Floka Flame!
maneki_neko: Thanks Kayla :slightly_smiling_face: It was really awesome. I actually set up my Yoshi stuffed animal and people really like him haha
maneki_neko: It was a bit overwhelming, but so much fun!
pfaendtner: Great job, Miwa!!!
slackbot: Miwaka Floka Flame!
maneki_neko: Thanks :smile:
pfaendtner: Does anyone know why the front office does not have canny anymore.  Canny being the preferred spelling and pronounciation
maneki_neko: <missing_message>
maneki_neko: If anyone would like to be my mentor tomorrow
maneki_neko: Free lunch included
pfaendtner: shoot - I wish I could come Miwa but I can’t make it to this
slackbot: Miwaka Floka Flame!
maneki_neko: :joy: oh no
coco: Whose container it is?
ldgibson: Hey , for my group meeting this monday (8/21), I’m planning on giving a paper review as practice for my upcoming prelim. I’m attaching the link to the paper for anyone that wants to read it before hand and come up with comments or questions. And of course, since this is supposed to be practice for my prelim, I welcome any and all questions that seem relevant in this context. Thanks! 
<http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jp501178n>
pfaendtner: awe yeah!
pfaendtner: what about the eclipse
ldgibson: oh yeah, did we want to try to move group meeting since the eclipse is happening during our entire group meeting?
slackbot: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
ldgibson: Is there no group meeting next week (8/28)? Because if so, we can just push this group meeting back a week if people aren’t busy/out of town on the 28th
chrisfu: fine by me
pfaendtner: Does it work for maneki_neko
coco: Are we going to have a group eclipse observation?
coco: :dancingbanana:
coco: :sunglasses:
pfaendtner: we can take turns looking in my binoculars
coco: :new_moon_with_face:
maneki_neko: I am ok with this plan
anotherjoshsmith: Sunoculars-Blue with 8x the magnification of Eclipse Glasses 
coco: that is very expensive
coco: for glasses that you use once for 10 years..
coco: Do we have group meeting today?
coco: If not I will be out of office staring at sun with my :sunglasses:
anotherjoshsmith: coco The three people presenting agreed to push it back until next week. Don't burn those retinas :scream:
coco: thx josh
coco: And those three people 
pfaendtner: is anyone in the offce going to go look @ eclipse?
pfaendtner: what time is it even happening
slackbot: <missing_message>
ldgibson: I believe the peak eclipse happens at 10
anotherjoshsmith: Starts in 5 minutes, peaks at 10:21, ends at 11:40
anotherjoshsmith: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: don’t look in the sun coco!!!
anotherjoshsmith: wut how'd you get that shot??
arushi: wow
arushi: is anybody going from benson?
anotherjoshsmith: I can watch it through my window, so I'm working in my room right now :sweat_smile: If no one on campus has glasses I can bring them in a little after the peak!
sarahalamdari: Haha I have a box and I'm at the fountain if you want to come peek arushi! 
arushi: oh awesome, I will be there
anotherjoshsmith: How's the box working?? The glasses just make everything black but the sun, I hope you can actually see the corona!
sarahalamdari: So I thought the pinhole was awesome but someone just let me borrow their glasses :joy: so now it's less awesome 
coco: And if you use your phone it could catch a reflection 
pfaendtner: it looks like coco was on the moon when she took that picture!! :crescent_moon:
coco: This is awesome 
coco: <missing_message>
arushi: Is being excited for the eclipse same as supporting STEM? :confused:
anotherjoshsmith: Undoubtedly
wesleybeckner: indubitably
anotherjoshsmith: <missing_message>
anotherjoshsmith: wesleybeckner
wesleybeckner: lol
sarahalamdari: This is so cool (for mac users) if no one else knew this.. No more chrome remote desktop!! 
sarahalamdari: ^ I only have one screen not sure how it works with multiple monitors
pfaendtner: What is it?! How it work?!
sarahalamdari: Black magic
sarahalamdari: I guess macs come with a VNC client so you can just type a VNC address for the mac you want to access in safari or their screen sharing app and it works really well! The resolution is way better than chrome remote desktop in my opinion
sarahalamdari: And!! You can toggle the size by adjusting the window which is super nice
sarahalamdari: :dancingbanana:
ldgibson: how is the input lag, any different?
sarahalamdari: I donut think so
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
luizoliveira:  could you please send papers and news so I can update the website
kellythornton:  Hello All, I will be out of the office for the next 2 week (back on September 18). Jim will be handling JRT and his schedule during that time, so if you need a meeting, go directly to him. Have a great weekend!
pfaendtner: have fun kellythornton :clowntown:
pfaendtner:  are you guys keeping your group meeting at the same time? Currently BNS 109 is not reserved but I can do the rez if you want
arushi: wesleybeckner ?
wesleybeckner: Pending no future schedule changes we've converged on a few options. I'll link those here. To avoid T/Th conflicts with DeForest/Baneyx lets start with Wed at 1:30? It looks like there's staff interviews that conflict with this week but I can schedule the rest of the group meetings when front office folks get in 
pfaendtner: would you guys like to have a pre-battical meeting with me? I am essentially going to accept your plan as your proposed it
pfaendtner: but not sure if there are other things to discuss - I guess we need to make some plans about node usage and how to do that so maybe we should meet next week
arushi: yah
sarahalamdari: Hi guyss! I’m giving a prelim-style paper critique on Thurs at 2:30 in BNS 109, if you can make it and give some feedback I would appreciate it!
sarahalamdari: ^ if you wanna give it a read :slightly_smiling_face:
wesleybeckner: we have group meetings booked in B109 Weds 1:30-3:00 for fall quarter
ldgibson: thanks Wesley!
wesleybeckner: we just need to figure out sequence of presenters
pfaendtner:  meeting start time 12:45 pm tomorrow (-15 min)
pfaendtner: I am putting in the order for 9 mox nodes.  WOOT!
pfaendtner: will 252 cores on mox help a bit? :wink:
daniel: :metal::metal::metal:
pfaendtner: Nice job!!!
maneki_neko: Thanks!!
sarahalamdari: Woah!
wesleybeckner: anyone used hashing in python?
wesleybeckner: I'm like, why is this dude randomly multiplying by 397 and then...
wesleybeckner: "Probably because 397 is a prime of sufficient size to cause the result variable to overflow and mix the bits of the hash somewhat, providing a better distribution of hash codes. There's nothing particularly special about 397 that distinguishes it from other primes of the same magnitude."
coco: Usually we just divide the number by a large prime number..
coco: or multiply by a prime number and then divide by a large prime number
kejiawu: And I personally like 397 this number:thinking_face:
pfaendtner: JRT setup next week for everyone I didn’t meet with this week. I picked the order of meetings based on seniority and exam schedules.  Please swap with each other if you need to make changes.  If you can’t make those times we will setup a Slack meeting.  Let me know if this works OK for ya’ll
pfaendtner: who is presenting at GSS? When is it?!
arushi: wesleybeckner
sarahalamdari: sarahalamdari
sarahalamdari: jk just doing a poster
sarahalamdari: Sept 25th?
pfaendtner: I think you guys should organize a round of practice talks for your posters and presentations (IMO)
sarahalamdari: Are we starting group meeting back on the 20th?
arushi: Yeah. And we are looking for 2 other presenter apart from Wes.
arushi: you in?
sarahalamdari: yes !
wesleybeckner: yes will give my practice talk at group meeting next week
pfaendtner: Is anyone using the Ilahie queue and do you notice if it is full/empty?
arushi: I was using it until last week. Consistently getting 13 nodes.
pfaendtner: :thumbsup::skin-tone-4:
arushi: For R5+phosphate ion sims
pfaendtner: I heard a lot of it is not used that much
arushi: Maybe. Haven’t been tracking it like our nodes!
pfaendtner: justcurious, no worries :slightly_smiling_face:
pfaendtner:  my intention tomorrow was to have the meeting times in order I listed them in JRT block.  arushi wesleybeckner ksakloth you added additional meetings - can you talk to the right people and take care of this?
arushi:  Oh haha, i didn't know that. Ok with any order 
wesleybeckner: also ok with any order :thumbsup:
wesleybeckner: got it
pfaendtner:  check out this awesome news about Michele Parrinello!
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: The award ceremony is tomorrow morning at 7am live on the USI page…
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: Parrinello will give a lecture too
arushi: So cool!
ksakloth: okay got it thanks
pfaendtner: Elizabeth and I are recruiting a jointly advised PhD student , will probably start in our group doing simulations
pfaendtner: I am also adding 2 MS students to recruiting
pfaendtner: you guys are welcome to hold an open house again if you want to (i ken pay) , but don’t feel obligated
pfaendtner: I guess we r going to take two phd students this year?! The other will come from MolES or chemistry ...
arushi: WHAAAAAAAT ?!?!!
pfaendtner: Believe it!!!! This is happening :nerd_face::nerd_face::nerd_face:
wesleybeckner: I have a smoke machine and lazers for the OH
pfaendtner: MY SMOKE MACHINE IS MY CUT GLASS CRYSTAL BONG :dash: :dash: 
pfaendtner: group - do you guys want to host an open house like you did last year for our prospective recruits?
coco: I am so sad you are not open to MSE students:cry:
pfaendtner: There are some good reasons to recruit from Chem this year. But maybe MSE!! I can discuss with you 
coco: Dear friends, in what circumstance gmx energy has no density option?:thinking_face:
coco: It's been a year and gromacs is still a mystery to me.
kejiawu: I met the same problem like half a year ago
kejiawu: mysterious ORZ
pfaendtner: i think it depends on what ensemble u simulatin’
coco: yeah, seems nvt does not have density? but why?:cry:
pfaendtner: g_energy just reports quantities that have fluctuations. Density does not fluctuate in NVT. It is fixed. You can calculate it by hand using mass of system and the volume of the box
amirh.mafi: Or you can use gmx density!
coco: sounds right:thinking_face:
arushi: Hey all, so sorry but it seems like I have a stomach flu or something. Been in the bathroom for a while and I don't think I'll be able to make it in today.
wesleybeckner: we'll miss ya arushi feel better!
anotherjoshsmith:  Anyone want to jump in on group meeting today in Arushi's place?
anotherjoshsmith: Reached back in the ol' email for this blurb from Jim, circa 2015, on group meeting format. Should match well with our sabbatical style meetings:
anotherjoshsmith: "The format for group meetings will be:  3 talks = 15 mins total time each.  You can talk for up to 10 minutes , but there will be a minimum of 5 minutes of Q/A.  I will enforce group participation (people still do not ask very many questions by taking 1st two questions from people in a rotating fashion).  At minimum you should cover: 

1) high level goals of your project 
2) what have you been doing since last time you presented  [ show us at least 1 interesting result]
3) what are you going to be doing in the short-term to advance progress on this project
4) what is one example of a hypothesis you are currently working on testing with your simulations 

I expect that you can all cover these 4 items in 10 minutes. "
coco: Nice outline!
anotherjoshsmith: A 5th item might be sticking points. What issues have you had in addressing the specific hypothesis in point 4?
wesleybeckner: we can earmark me as a last resort if no one wants to take the slot
luizoliveira: thanks Wes!
pfaendtner: feel better soon Ru!
pfaendtner: you could also use time to futher discuss node_usage channel etc
coco: Where is the group meeting happening.. 109 is under construction 
chrisfu: 2nd floor meeting room is open 
coco: :+1::skin-tone-2:
anotherjoshsmith: There is a Startup Career and Internship Fair next Wednesday from 2-4pm (one hour overlap with CIP). pfaendtner Any opposition to pushing 3-6pm CIP meeting to 4-7pm?
coco: I am going to HPCC training session at 4:30
pfaendtner: Sorry. That is probably not going to work timing wise.  We can reschedule it if you guys don't want to do it then?
pfaendtner: how about we just do 4-6 next wed and then go quickly :slightly_smiling_face:
pfaendtner: I was going to give you an update on my research projectrs but I can skip :wink:
pfaendtner: ^ this helps me so I can meet with a prospective PhD student
pfaendtner: no responses? I assume you guys don’t care or aren’t reading this channel
pfaendtner: I took a meeting w/prospective student from 3:30-4 next Wed
pfaendtner: question: is someone going to go early or make a reservation at CIP? If not, are you worried about getting good space for us? It fills up pretty fast during 1st few weeks of shcool before things get busy
arushi: All those times definitely work for me.
luizoliveira: Yesterday during group meeting I proposed to make a reservation 
luizoliveira: the time is ok for me. I'm gonna need to leave at 5 though. ( Wed is the only day I need to pick Lydia up, because Patricia works at night)  
luizoliveira: Thanks arushi 
chrisfu: so there is an hpcc mentorship meeting at 4:00-4:30 on Wed, that I need to attend (and maybe arushi &amp; sarahalamdari). But can come after
arushi: Can’t we reschedule the HPCC one since you are in-charge of it? :wink:
chrisfu: yeah but we want the mentees to attend the training session that immediately follows so it makes the most sense to do it then
pfaendtner: so 5 people can’t go or will be late next wed or have a conflict? do you guys think we should reschedule?
arushi: yes, sounds like rescheduling might be the best idea!
arushi: What other dates/times work for you pfaendtner?
pfaendtner: I’ll have to check my schedule.  Maybe April :laughing:
pfaendtner: In lieu of this I am going to maybe see if any of the chemistry theory students want to go for a happy hour next wed to learn about our group (seems like we are not going to do the open house this year).  Would anyone want to join?
slackbot: :beer: *slurp* *burp* ヾ(o✪‿✪o)ｼ
arushi: Ya, sounds good!
arushi: Wait, you have chemistry theory students?
arushi: What’s happening?
coco: Sounds awesome! 
kejiawu: Chemistry theory!
arushi: I can join!!

wesleybeckner: should I contact little Rex?
wesleybeckner: Rex Jr.
wesleybeckner: New Rex
luizoliveira: Please contact him. Last week he told me he has already been there to see this printer, it seems that it didn’t work then. Btw Jesse actually introduced himself as the New Rex. haha
wesleybeckner: haha yeah I think he did to me as well
pfaendtner: the question is whether we should call him “good rex” or “bad rex” ?
luizoliveira: a much better Rex, definitely.
luizoliveira:  guys, Jim said that a better day to meet at College Inn would be 11/15, i.e., we have group meeting next Wed, as scheduled. Khushemeen said she can’t present due to an interview. kejiawu, can you take her spot as you didn’t present this past Wed?

wesleybeckner: luizoliveira we were thinking of snagging this bad boi for CIP meetings. I'll need to double check if there are outlets in the back room. this projector has sameday shipping 
luizoliveira: ok
luizoliveira: I’ve just called over there. The room is already reserved :disappointed:
luizoliveira: they do have the outlets, though
luizoliveira: Last week, Jim also said that he could meet us next Wed. I need to double check with him (pfaendtner)
arushi: Happy hours can be without alcohol too, right? Like at UW :smile:
pfaendtner: I can’t do next Wed - that is right before the holiday and I already planned out my day. We don’t need to goto a bar though, happy to just meet in B17 tomorrow or another location - please decide by noon today if you want to meet tomorrow or not.  I could do next Tuesday afternoon if you wanted  and can reserve the room
arushi: : Please vote!
arushi: pfaendtner: Looks like Tuesday, 21st November works for most people!
arushi: If that still works for you, what’s the best time for you to meet?
pfaendtner: its fine - anytime in the afternoon - if you guys want to goto a bar someone need to reserve a space :slightly_smiling_face: :slightly_smiling_face:
luizoliveira: Well, contrary to what I thought College Inn does take reservation one week in advance. :smile: It is done, we have the room over there from 4-7, next Tuesday.
pfaendtner: ugh
pfaendtner: I was literally just typing that I have to leave campus next Tuesday mid-afternoon! Sorry guys - can we do 9:45-11:45 in Benson 109? I can bring coffee and pastry and some fruit :open_mouth: not the same as beer, I know
pfaendtner: we need to do happy hr , week of Dec 27! celebrate sarah, luke, coco exams
pfaendtner: thinking Wed 29 if that works for ldgibson sarahalamdari coco
pfaendtner: sorry luizoliveira - I was trying to resolve a few things and didn’t realize this would happen w/my scheudle
luizoliveira: ok, no problem
pfaendtner: what is the 9:30 am Monday 11/20 Pfaendtner lab meeting in BNS 109 - is that you guys?
luizoliveira: don’t think so
luizoliveira: well I don’t know I didn’t book 109 this quarter
pfaendtner: no worries
wesleybeckner: luizoliveira can we order more dry erase markers?
wesleybeckner: :grimacing:
ldgibson: Hi friends (and Chris), since we’ll be having group meeting with Jim tomorrow in B17 and we’re all presenting, Google Slides is probably the best way to organize our information. I believe the consensus was each person gets 1 slide, 5 min of presentation, and 5 min of discussion. Here is a link to the presentation, you all should be able to edit it: 
ldgibson: <missing_message>
ksakloth: Hello  I will not be able to join tomorrow due to prior commitments on Tuesdays, have a great meeting! 
luizoliveira: I’m going to order them wesleybeckner, arushi can you send me, by tomorrow, a link from amazon to the external driver you’d like me to order?
pfaendtner: see you guys at 10 , I will bring some pastries!
coco: where are we meeting :no_mouth::no_mouth:
kejiawu: 109 coco!
wesleybeckner: luizoliveira
wesleybeckner: I don't need an external driver thanks!
pfaendtner:  just want to wish everyone an awesome Thanksgiving and long holiday weekend. I hope you relax a bit and I hope you keep the nodes burning too :wink: see you next week
luizoliveira:  I scheduled group meetings for the next three weeks.  3 people presenting per week were too many presentations as in this way each one should present every 3 weeks. Then, I scheduled only 2 people per meeting. I didn’t change the time slot. Still from 1:30-3. Of course, we can finish earlier. And we can go beyond 20 minutes per person if necessary. Let’s discuss this at the last meeting of the year (12/13).
anotherjoshsmith: luizoliveira The original intention was that in one month we should cycle through everyone in three weeks and have our 4th meeting at CIP with Jim. They are meant to be quick, informal presentations aimed at checking in with progress and pushing through road blocks, so mo' often is mo' betta
luizoliveira: ok, I updated the group meetings then
anotherjoshsmith: Thanks! Let's still plan to use the end of the 12/13 meeting to discuss any format changes for next term
coco: Anyone has used acpype?..I have been installing stuff for a whole day now... does not feel right..
coco: :sob:\
arushi: it's just a python script, no installation needed
arushi: ksakloth works with it
coco: I am not only using the script but the whole package
ldgibson:  anyone planning on going to the happy hour tomorrow at 5pm please react to this message with :beers:

maneki_neko: Lol not unless I want to get arrested. :joy:
ldgibson: I'm sure we can whip you up a fake ID really quick, Chris has the 128 pack of crayons in his desk at all times for occasions like this
maneki_neko: Crayola is good for any situation - confirmed.
luizoliveira: wesleybeckner or arushi or anyone else I got a package at the front desk. I think it’s the dry erase markers (and some batteries) or Arushi’s external hard driver. Can you, please, get it?
kejiawu: Anyone has met "Segmentation fault" for plumed driver? Keep getting it and have no idea why..:cry:
luizoliveira: Segmentation fault is the worst error you can get
luizoliveira: :wink:
luizoliveira: It can be anything.
aren’t there any message with it?

slackbot: <missing_message>
pfaendtner:  I had a long talk w/Pratyush and Matteo Salvalaggio at the RARE meeting - we are going to try to come up w/updated recommendations that do a better job than P-value KS test…. probably will be asking you for data sets where you find sample size issues with your iMetaD calculations.
coco: Anyone familiar with boxmaker?
luizoliveira:  Please let me know by tomorrow if group meetings from 3:00-4:30 on Wednesdays are OK for everyone ( I looking for an answer from those who didn’t attend the last group meeting)
pfaendtner: if anyone has been suffering from unbearably small superscript fonts in Mac Word it is due to a Sierra update.  You need to ensure you are using “Times New Roman” font and not just plain “Times”
cnyambr: hi, everyone, I was what time as to what time everyone decided to schedule their meeting with Kelly Thornton. Also, has she been added to slack? I was thinking of emailing her directly.
slackbot: <missing_message>
arushi: Yes, she’s on Slack!
pfaendtner: kellythornton is here!
kellythornton: Thanks all! cnyambr just sent you a message about the schedule
pfaendtner: I will schedule individual meetings once Janani’s schedule is set
pfaendtner:  reminder to avoid using the font “Times” as it messes up superscripts.  “Times New Roman” is preferred. Thank you! Jim
arushi: arushi pinned a message to this channel.
luizoliveira:  I just posted the schedule for our group meetings on the calendar from 01/10 - 03/14. We’ll need to start earlier than planned (2:30 instead of 3) because there is group with a group meetings planned to start at 4. So we will go from 2:30 - 4. Please let me know asap if any of you have conflicts with this time. pfaendtner, please check if you can meet us on 02/07 and on 03/14.
pfaendtner: Can we meet on 2/5 instead of 2/7 please? I am host of seminar that week, so I will be on campus for sure.   tons of BNS 109 availability
pfaendtner: 3/14 is good - lets do happy hour if we can get a reservation somewhere that is quiet enough taht we can still talk - 4-6?

luizoliveira:   after two days of “negotiations” with the front desk, starting this week, we will finally meet Fridays from 10:00 to 11:30
anotherjoshsmith: luizoliveira Great, thanks for setting that up!
luizoliveira: yeah, no problem. Part of my job. Btw, I don’t know if you guys know but the information on this page helped me to get B109 in the time frame that worked the best for us: 
anotherjoshsmith: : hyak is back. Let those nodes feel your pent up rage from yesterday.
arushi: Alright!
coco: This morning I was looking at 50 free nodes and don't know what to run
pfaendtner: How many 16 core nodes we own?

The 8 core going away end of Jan, btw 
arushi: why aren't jobs running on hyak?
arushi: :confused:
anotherjoshsmith: Looks like kejiawu has one running!
kejiawu: Yes! But after 2pm I can't add jobs anymore...
arushi: Yupp, she was the first person I asked
arushi: You got in at a good time, K!
kejiawu: Haha how's everybody now!?
kejiawu: :joy:
kejiawu: :thinking_face:
anotherjoshsmith: Nooooooo I just got to the submission stage :sob:
kejiawu: Maybe we need to wait until another good timing
ldgibson: pfaendtner 65 x 16core nodes, 14 x 8core nodes
anotherjoshsmith: Assuming the 8core nodes are heading off to start their postdoc at MIT
kejiawu: Wow
anotherjoshsmith: Can we have a happy hour to celebrate?

wesleybeckner: my mom owns a horse that is 25 years old...
pfaendtner: how can a horse even live that long - i thought they died at 5
pfaendtner: :confused:
anotherjoshsmith: Maybe it's a rocking horse
pfaendtner: like one that sings Elvis songs
anotherjoshsmith: in which case 25 years isn't all that impressive
anotherjoshsmith: that'd be surprisingly young for an elvis rocking horse
anotherjoshsmith: wesleybeckner Is the horse named Elvis?
wesleybeckner: hah his name is Royale (Roy-Al) he's old af
pfaendtner: Time to send him to the glue factory 
pfaendtner:  join me in congratulating wesleybeckner - ~3~ 4 months of a hard fight with a cranky reviewer to get his IL / NN paper done and !  coco is 2nd author on the paper - great job!  It is a really good paper. Our third one on machine learning in the past 2 years!

pfaendtner: beware upgrading Word because it might mess up your EndNote installation!
pfaendtner: you guys had been trying to book a group meeting with me in January but it never got settled?

pfaendtner: or in the morning if there is room available

I’ll try to present with the other three guys next week. Sarah has a doctor appointment that was made before we had to move the group meeting from Wed to Fri. *We are not faking sick.* :the_horns::skin-tone-4::muscle::skin-tone-4:

pfaendtner: I don’t know what computers we have anymore :slightly_smiling_face:
luizoliveira:  as everyone had (is going to have) JRT today (Monday) I’m canceling the short research updates on Monday. Jim is ok with that. I know I know, “what about the Happy Hour, Luiz?” Well let’s try it for next time. I tried to reserve a room at college in this  afternoon and I guess what? it already booked. Sorry about that, I should have called earlier, I put that in my important-but-not-urgent to-do list. :slightly_smiling_face:

exciting stuff.
pfaendtner: :point_up_2::skin-tone-3: how do they handle the non equilibrium stuff?

pfaendtner:  does anyone want to meet w/the seminar speaker today? his research area is materials data science. The available time slow it 10:30-11.  Need to know asap
cnyambr: I’m interested 
ldgibson: Hey all, I'm not feeling well so I'll be staying home today
pfaendtner: alright cnyambr - go for it :slightly_smiling_face: bring a buddy if you want.  Just be at Stu’s office at 10:30 and you can take him for coffee or to meet somewhere.  Stu knows if nobody shows up, then he will meet with him from 10:30 -11.  Seminar speakers sometimes run late so could be 5-10 late.  Please make sure you know where to deliver him at 11 and do so on time :slightly_smiling_face: thank you!!!

pfaendtner: ^ can I go for this too? I’d like to find a new career
maneki_neko: Hi guys. I'm applying for the Materials Engineering REU this summer, and I was wondering if I could get help picking a lab. I'm supposed to pick 2 from a list, but I don't know these people too well. :sweat_smile:
maneki_neko:  If you know anything about what these labs are like - it would really help me out!
arushi: All superb people actually!
arushi: Neat line-up
maneki_neko: Do you guys work with Christine Luscombe a lot? Her name sounds so familiar and I don't know why. @.@
wesleybeckner: wow how neat is that
arushi: Wes’ friend Wes works in her lab
wesleybeckner: other wesley works for christine
arushi: She coo
maneki_neko: Oh man... choosing is going to be difficult. Just from blurbs I was thinking Luscombe or Brandi Cossairt
arushi: Maybe consider Gamelin/Ginger too?
maneki_neko: That's why. xD
maneki_neko: David Ginger?
arushi: Gamelin or Ginger.
maneki_neko: I want to be able to work in a smaller lab if possible. :thinking_face:
maneki_neko: I don't think Crossfit addicts is a requirement. &gt;.&gt;
maneki_neko: wesleybeckner I should aim for Christine Luscombe and specifically ask for other Wes as my mentor. "Sorry I only work with people named Wes."
wesleybeckner: lol
wesleybeckner: do it
maneki_neko: Bonus if I can get him to do daily chicken runs.
wesleybeckner: do folks have a suggested resource for multi output regression models?
anotherjoshsmith: In the paper I saw, they kept data without overlap. They posited a shared representation of molecular structure is improved even if only one of the targets is contributing to updated weights for some training examples.
anotherjoshsmith: You might also look into multitask learning papers published by the Pande group out of Stanford. They seem to have characterized single task vs. multitask more thoroughly.
wesleybeckner: Thanks man!
wesleybeckner: Not feeling well today comrades I’ll be out of the office 
ksakloth: take care!
coco: Anybody has some nice inspiring paper to share? I need some motivation and inspiration recently..
kejiawu: Hahahahah
ldgibson: what a helpful caption in that picture

luizoliveira: Btw, have you guys heard of Pratyush, the supercomputer? 
sarahalamdari: I feel like chrisfu and I looked into that at some point, I think it does QM calculations with Gaussian right?
ksakloth: Hello , I had a change of timing for an interview and its clashing with group meeting , sorry about not attending :(

sarahalamdari: ahh kejiawu same :sob:
sarahalamdari: #ripjobs
arushi: take care all.
chrisfu:  we are currently over quota on ikt and have exceeded the deadline to get under
chrisfu: this is why we are getting out of disk space messages
maneki_neko: I'm going to make a punch card when I get home. :joy:
arushi: why?
maneki_neko: "Frequent over quota customer"
pfaendtner:  please fix this immediately
arushi: It's fixed! Yay
ldgibson: I’m still seeing 243 GB over?
chrisfu: it updates on the hour
chrisfu: but i think we should be under
arushi: Yeah, took a while to move files.
luizoliveira: chrisfu do you plan to move some of your ~4.5 T soon? If you move 1 T you will still be the “first” one.  pfaendtner do you know if  these users vjaeger, tunyia2, lutzh,  fischer4, eprates, and blasher can move/delete their files? Together there are using ~2.8 T
chrisfu: yep, theres a little over 2 TB i will move once we get through paper reviews. in the mean time i’ve moved my current projects to stf so that amount should be static
pfaendtner:  JRT posted for next week.  Several of you are helping w/grad recruiting - so if you need to trade, please work with the people who are volunteering for the department, etc..

arushi: Mar 14 sounds great to me, actually!
sarahalamdari: Still sick over here :-1: working from home this morneng 
pfaendtner: hey guys I learned a cool trick - if you send identical word documents to two people for revisions and they both change them you can use “compare and combine” under the review tab to marge them both into a new document.  All the changes are there by author! Thanks sarahalamdari and kayla
anotherjoshsmith: Hey y'all. There's a 'Careers in Data Science for Graduate Students'  panel/networking event at 4:30 tonight in Kane 110. I added an event on the calender and thought I'd drop a last minute reminder in case anyone is interested!

luizoliveira: are people experiencing a super slow ikt1 and ikt2 today?
chrisfu: on the hyak site:” ikt.Hyak is under maintenance at least one login server or the scheduler be be down at some point.”
luizoliveira: I’m not sure if that’s trustable as the first line of the section says `Jan10, 2018 10:55a`. They sent an email yesterday about mox, but anything about ikt, I think someone is running some job on the login nodes. That won’t be the first time.
luizoliveira: not only the date was wrong, but also the cluster’s name: From Adam Hough
2:16 PM (1 minute ago)
to me 
No, it was just Mox. I just updated the wrong cluster this morning.

arushi: Hey all!

The poster session for DIRECT projects is today from 4:30-6:30 pm at the NanoES first floor lobby

If you have time, please come and check out some of the wonderful data science project posters that the students are putting up. Some include battery signal processing (sarahalamdari), and image segmentation of AFM images (cnyambr), and ldgibson’s secret project
sarahalamdari: aww :slightly_smiling_face: u so sweet
arushi: Or come support a PRG at the poster session!
ldgibson: Isn't it in NanoES?
sarahalamdari: ldgibson has a cool project too!
sarahalamdari: haha I see ur edits arushi
arushi: no, I didn’t just misinform everyone
sarahalamdari: :joy:
pfaendtner:  let’s head for Chris and Ru happy hour around 6:06 at the poster session lobby. May be a bit after dat because I don’t know when it ends. 

My stomach feel weird 
slackbot: :beer: *slurp* *burp* ヾ(o✪‿✪o)ｼ
arushi: Yes, let's go
ksakloth: coco we’re in big time brewery , not Schultzys!
pfaendtner: Fun to see you all tonight! I miss you 
arushi: THANK YOU for taking us out tonight, Jim! We all miss you!
kejiawu: Where are you going Jim!?
kejiawu: Don't leave!
pfaendtner: Forgot to put your grades in. I’ll fix it! 
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: I am working on two large center proposals that are due in two weeks, sorry if I am less available than usual.  these things have lots of last minute requests...
wesleybeckner:  we’re meeting in benson 125. 109 is under construction :construction: 
wesleybeckner: The door code is 123456
luizoliveira: I wasn’t aware of that, I was only informed of a conflict on the week of May 28th. I talked with Caroline and hopefully we won’t have problems in the coming weeks. For May 29th, I will reserve a room in Moles and let you know. We apologize for the inconvenience. :chewie:
coco: I post it in the error log too but I think people are not checking that channel much recently…
so.. I had a lot error like this:
Fatal error:
Atomtype OX not found
But this OX type is actually in the atomtype file…
This also happen to other additional atoms from surface and ion
coco: exit
coco: BTW I really need some help: my neighbor is screaming loudly for 7hours now as if he is in pain.. it has been like this for a couple of weeks now. I called police twice today police came and knocked at the door but no one answers.  Now the police is gone and he is screaming louder. It’s so terrifying and disturbing. What should I do
ldgibson: That's crazy coco, maybe call your landlord?
coco: I write to the manager of the apartment a few days ago…  the manager text to the tenant live below us and the screaming stopped for a few day… but yesterday it had been going for at least ..7 hours until 2:00 when I finally find a nice ear plug
pfaendtner: coco - that OX error might be because the name of your terminal O atom in the PDB doesn’t match the force field kayla can you verify?
pfaendtner: also that screaming seems very disturbing, sorry to hear that :confused: if you can get a good audio recording of it, you should share w/the apartment management company
pfaendtner: two PRG papers accepted this week! nice job chrisfu and luizoliveira
sarahalamdari: congrats guys!! :tada:
arushi: Congrats!!

pfaendtner: good visit at WSU today! cool collaboration opportunities with protein surface people and reactions at interfaces people
anotherjoshsmith: Check out this little number franz: 
anotherjoshsmith: ignore the fact that i've messed up the metad reweighting... i'll get to that tomorrow.
anotherjoshsmith: actually just go directly to the pbmetad part haha
pfaendtner: Arushi just pointed me to this:  kinda interesting!
wesleybeckner: I've been enjoying some of this - 
wesleybeckner: he's a data scientist in Brazil :smile:
anotherjoshsmith: Hey guys, I'm gonna miss group meeting today. Had a 3.5 hour meeting with Shaoyi's group this morning and I need to commit some extra time to my DIRECT capstone project to avoid falling behind. I won't make a habit out of this, sorrryyyyyy luv you all.
anotherjoshsmith:  FRIENDS! Dave Beck suggested asking you all to star and fork plumitas so it looks like there's some buzz about it... So please follow this link and press the star and fork buttons :pray::skin-tone-3:
<https://github.com/UWPRG/plumitas>
anotherjoshsmith: tell yo frenz
sarahalamdari: ooh!! exciting
ldgibson: on it, cap’n
pfaendtner: Don’t ever forget what it looks like when I go on vacation 
luizoliveira: maybe helpful for your taxes

ksakloth: How was the talk ? I just saw this :(
luizoliveira:  vmd on mox `module load vmd/1.9.3_CUDA8-OptiX4-OSPRay111p1.opengl`
sarahalamdari: ahh!!! yay
luizoliveira: there is another vmd module that has just text mode, I guess they’ll delete it and update this one.
coco: Yay
luizoliveira: If you guys want to use VMD with CUDA 
04/19/2018 4:30 PM PDT - Adam Hough	Additional Comments
Actually Matt figured out the correct steps to get the window to work.

You can also request an node from the ckpt queue and use “--gres=gpu:P100:1” to request a node with a gpu.

Example.

salloc -p ckpt  -A GRPOUPNAME-ckpt --time=4:00:00 --nodes=1 --mem=120G  --gres=gpu:P100:1

I am going to close this ticket since VMD on mox apprears to work.

So there are 2 versions installed on Mox now, one with a GUI and one that is Text mode.

pfaendtner: sarah and I worked on this cartoon today to try and help us understand her simulations in context of the _mechanism_ we are trying to study
pfaendtner: I strongly encourage you to develop your own versions of slides like this for all of your projects. They are really useful for presentations (both to specialized and non-specialized audiences), they help practice and hone your teaching skills, they help me in my presentations and grant proposals, and *most importantly - they force us to take our simulations and map them onto a mechanistic interpretation that can be hypothesis tested *
luizoliveira: Guys, I’m busy preparing for a meeting regarding visa issues and preparing for an “interview” in the evening. So, unfortunately, I’m unable to attend today’s group meeting.
wesleybeckner: ^Kush shared this with me, might be helpful for others using Keras!
wesleybeckner: also this is kind of a neat dataset, shows desired datascience languages/skills etc from linked-in postings
sarahalamdari: ldgibson just showed me this!! you can have ALL the tabs  
pfaendtner: :face_with_rolling_eyes:  all of them?!
sarahalamdari: Haha ew
anotherjoshsmith: what's the purpose of a drink with no caffeine or sugar? water had that covered way before humans got into the soft drink game
pfaendtner: daniel arushi look at all this sampling!!!
pfaendtner: on! off! on! off!
cnyambr: Fishy tricks 
sarahalamdari: lol aww!
chrisfu:  Hey Everyone, my IGERT advisor Marina Meila in the stats department has offered to give a group meeting on the work she does (clustering and manifold learning). Would a Tuesday at 4PM be a good time to schedule this? We haven’t picked a date yet, but are trying to lock in on a time
chrisfu: here is her website:  she said if we give a her a list of topics we are interested in she will discuss them
kejiawu: Oh wow!
massimiliano.bonomi: pfaendtner she can solve the collective variable problem, you must work with her!!!!
massimiliano.bonomi: manifold learning…
pfaendtner: Awesome opportunity!!!

luizoliveira:  if you want a tv or know someone who wants one, feel free to take the one which is on B49. I’m gonna move it this weekend to the surplus hallway if no one takes it. 
ksakloth: I have a friend who’d like to take it 
ksakloth: For anyone else who might be interested :smile:
ksakloth: Hello, Garrett (my PNNL mentor) is presenting in eScience seminar next Tuesday about his work in Deep learning in chemistry. Since its from 2-3pm (same as group meeting) and if people are interested , we can shift group meeting to 3-4:30 , else I can work an arrangement out for presenting
coco: cooooool
pfaendtner: Please go to Garret’s talk!!
arushi: : As per Khushmeen’s suggestion, are we moving group meeting to 3-4:30 pm, and attending Garrett’s talk from 2-3 pm?
Khushmeen, Luke, and Chris are presenting
coco: I can do that
cnyambr: I can do that too
ldgibson: I believe that Karl is supposed to be taking my place for group meeting. I will also be unable to attend since I will be at the ECS conference all day tomorrow.
luizoliveira: Yes, Karl wants to rehearse for his defense, please check with him before moving the group meeting, also confirm that B109 will be available at that time.
cnyambr:  So I was wondering if anyone was interested in participating in the DYSS selection committee. I need to know before 5 pm today and the current committee needs someone to participate in the selection process. The panel convenes in two parts:  
This year's Distinguished Young Scholars Seminar (DYSS) series is starting to come together and it is time to put together the selection panel which will choose this year's presenters. We need your help to make this panel!
 
The panel will convene on two dates, and attendance to both is mandatory. 
1) Friday, May 18th 11:30 am - 1:00 pm: An introductory meeting with a discussion on biases in selection processes as well as a short practice session with the rubric. Applicant assignments will go out the following morning. All assigned applications (usually 5-10) must be reviewed and scored by Wednesday May 23rd at 5 pm.
 
2) Thursday, May 24th 9:30 am - 12:30 pm: The selection panel event. It usually takes a few hours and coffee/snacks will be provided.
 
We would like to have at least one member of each research group serve on the selection panel. That said, we welcome all who are interested in being involved, first years included. By having a broader knowledge base, it will be easier to assign the applications to people more familiar with the applicant's research area. I highly encourage everybody to be a part of this process. It is an excellent opportunity to see what top ChemE application packages look like!
 
To sign up please fill out the form at the following address by Friday May 11th:
<https://goo.gl/forms/7vRNoGePTsyD4dNz2>
cnyambr: Please let me know or let Nicole Thompson know. I had volunteered but I can't do it anymore due to meeting conflicts
cnyambr: Also, if you decide to participate in the panel, you have to be committed to both meeting sessions
pfaendtner: would be great to have a PRG represent at this! we want to get a good simulation talk (at least 1) at DYSS!
chrisfu: Looks like Benson 109 is booked from 3:30-5PM…
chrisfu:  is there group meeting today? if so when/where?
luizoliveira: Didn’t hear anything from people interested in the seminar, we are having group meeting as scheduled, same time, same place
wesleybeckner:  hey guys I confirmed with Kush, Karl, Chris that they can present 1-2:30 tomorrow and I have benson 109 reserved. I think let’s do our best to support our fellow grads and go that route. That also gives us time to see Garret’s talk today.
arushi: Thank you Wes :) 
Khushmeen and Karl are both practicing tomorrow.
ksakloth: thanks Wes!
luizoliveira: cool!
coco: sounds good!
maneki_neko: Sounds good. :D I went to support my ChemE TAs this morning.
maneki_neko: Guys. What's the name of that poster editing software you use?
maneki_neko: I'm making a poster for my NME class.
coco: inkscape？
maneki_neko: oohhh. Thank you coco!
wesleybeckner: inkscape + gimp
maneki_neko: That was it. ^^
maneki_neko: Thanks Wes!
chrisfu: , if you have a preference please fill out the poll before Tuesday. Thanks
pfaendtner: I will be out of town on the 29th. On June 5 we have Kejia MS exam (12:3-1:30) and Bonomi seminar (2-3pm), fyi.  
slackbot: wajia kno abou dah?
ksakloth: When are we taking a group photo ? (website one is tooo old)
ksakloth: Does anyone have the clicker which is in Luizs drawer ?
luizoliveira: It’s with me. :grinning:
luizoliveira: I’ll be there in Benson in 10 min
luizoliveira:  let’s take a group picture in front of the Fountain on Thu at 9, during Jim’s coffee time? pfaendtner  :+1::skin-tone-6: or :-1::skin-tone-3:?
maneki_neko: 9 AM?
luizoliveira: yes
coco: coooooo
luizoliveira:  Hey guys I haven’t heard back from Jim and without the boss there is no group picture… So I’m canceling it. Let’s try to do it on June 5. I’m going to confirm sooner than that with him this time, it was very last minute. Sorry ksakloth I’m sure you wanted the pic for your presentation tomorrow…
ksakloth: No worries :) 
maneki_neko: Oh no! Try again next time. :D
pfaendtner: Crap!! Sorry guys!!
pfaendtner: I have been in the weeds with AIChE programming and promotion paperwork that is all due before I leave for the weekend 
pfaendtner: Picture is fine if still ok for people. Many apologies.  Please text me in the future if a fast response is needed. But I will be more present starting in the coming weeks. Sabbatical is almost over! 
coco: Hey guys, I am not feeling well this morning and has to cancel my jrt time from 10:20 to 10:40. You guys can use that time.
ksakloth: Take care coco !
wesleybeckner: :camera_with_flash:
luizoliveira: It would be nice to have you in the picture, coco. Let’s try it in June
wesleybeckner: :spiral_calendar_pad:
luizoliveira:  group meeting is gonna be in BNS125
luizoliveira: code to get in B125 is 123456
pfaendtner: Come to chairs lecture today if you can. Should be a decent spread at the reception starting at 3...
pfaendtner: who got batteries?
anotherjoshsmith: I have AAAs
pfaendtner: need AA :confused:
pfaendtner: can I just use 2/3 of one AAA?
anotherjoshsmith: i won't stop you from trying!
maneki_neko: I mean I have AA batteries if you really need them. :neutral_face:
coco: What's happening on hyak..? been like this since Tuesday..
coco: <missing_message>
coco: <missing_message>
pfaendtner:  there are a few summer students from KAUST at the UW (ChemE background) and looking for research experiences.  It would be a 5-6 week gig, let me know if you have any projects / interest in mentoring such a student
maneki_neko: Woah they are coming all the way from Saudia Arabia?
luizoliveira: I had some in my famous second drawer but they just disappeared.
luizoliveira: coco I think this is related to the email Jim sent us last week.
coco: luizoliveira got it! thank you!
anotherjoshsmith: luizoliveira The email to Jim said the switch to slurm would stop jobs during the July 10th maintenance window. It doesn't explain why ikt isn't allowing us to submit jobs now. Maybe the nodes unionized and called a strike to improve leverage ahead of the scheduler change in July.
luizoliveira: yes maybe
luizoliveira: I don’t have problems submitting jobs
pfaendtner: Don’t make me hire scab nodes 
luizoliveira: I was referring to the output when we run nodestate  “JulyMaintenance”
luizoliveira: I contacted hyak people yesterday about it, this is their response: 
Hi Luiz,

We created a reservation for our July maintenance (to ensure no jobs are still running when we need to take the nodes down for the maintenance) -- something about it appears to be breaking the nodestate script.  I’m investigating.

-Matt
anotherjoshsmith: Can you get an interactive node? That's all i'm asking for!!!?!?!?!?!?!
anotherjoshsmith: ne'er mind. arushi said she got one after waiting 10-15 mins
anotherjoshsmith: sarahalamdari told me to try stf. totally worked right away. in case anyone else needs an interactive node and doesn't want to wait: `qsub -I -V -X -q int -l walltime=12:00:00,nodes=1:ppn=16,feature=16core -W group_list=hyak-stf`
coco: submitting job is fine but can not check queue status…
I get interactive nodes just fine~
coco: longer waiting time maybe…
kejiawu: Same with Coco
kejiawu: Happy Children's Day though!
maneki_neko: For a second I thought you had students in your drawer.
coco: luizoliveira I borrowed two from you but they don’t work… There are some on the wall behind my seat..
coco: they are not good either.. only last a few days.
pfaendtner: I took the batteries from luiz drawer :slightly_smiling_face:
coco: Anyone could kindly share some mox scripts with me? like pbs, location of gmx and plumed?
luizoliveira: `nodestate`
luizoliveira: is back
pfaendtner:  group meetings for summer Thursdays 2:00-3:30 , please tell me asap if that doesn’t work.
pfaendtner: starting Thur 28 june
pfaendtner:  we resume individual meetings week of June 18.  kellythornton will be scheduling them with everyone on a weekly basis.  The JRT calendar is going to be orphaned after that point because I have to migrate away from UW/Google into UW/exchange
pfaendtner: luizoliveira if you can make the group meeting schedule for 6/28 , [skip 7/5 - holiday] , 7/12, [skip 7/19 - FOMMS], 7/26 , Janani can take over after that
ksakloth:  I won’t be in today since my parents are in town , kejiawu good luck for your defence !!
luizoliveira: pfaendtner I will do
luizoliveira:  FYI, decided to organize the group picture when Janani gets here
pfaendtner:  happy hour for daniel ksakloth kejiawu!  Thursday 5:30 pm. I think many of us will be in the DSS for DIRECT so we could leave from there directly?  

daniel kayla kejiawu: where do you guys want to go? It is last week of class - should someone make a reservation at Schultzys just in case (luizoliveira, sarahalamdari - maybe one of you will be a silent hero)
slackbot: :beer: *slurp* *burp* ヾ(o✪‿✪o)ｼ
pfaendtner: do you guys know how many GPU nodes we have?
chrisfu: i think 10 on mox
daniel: Hey  I will have my exam at 1pm at DSS. PRGs are very welcome to my defense. :metal::metal::metal:
coco: cooool！
maneki_neko: I totally would but I have a final today. Good luck!!
arushi: Good luck, miwaaa!
maneki_neko: You should give that good luck to Daniel, though. xD Thanks Arushi!
maneki_neko: I did really well on my ChemE exam so I'm happy. They legit graded all 75 finals in less that 24 hours...

anotherjoshsmith:  Hiya folks! In case you missed it on the schedule, I'll be giving a practice talk today at 2pm in BNS 109. Most of my slides have never seen the light of day, so I'd really appreciate your attendance and feedback. I'll provide _*very tasty*_ snacks in case that helps convince you to join!
maneki_neko: I'm interested. :sunglasses:
arushi: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: ^ interesting
luizoliveira:  Per Jim’s request I made some updates on the group meeting calendar.

Here is the weekly meeting sign up for the week of July 2-6. With the holiday, it is a short week, so I have only listed times for Monday. If those don't work for you, let me know. Thank you!
luizoliveira:  someone used the group’s presentation clicker and didn’t return the usb stick that goes with it. Please, check and return it to my drawer by today. I need it today as tomorrow I’ll be traveling very early. (if the sign-in sheet was used… :disappointed:)

maneki_neko:  So professor Holt showed me this today. Apparently this is how his friend at General Mills feels like. :sweat_smile:
pfaendtner: I have revised the MetaD chapter - here it is if you’d like it for your records 

luizoliveira:  is someone else getting this or a similar error on ikt: “Please verify that both the operating system and the processor support Intel(R) F16C instructions”. ?

anotherjoshsmith: Would anyone be interested in a workshop on `git`/`Github` during the retreat? I'm not an expert, but I do have experience collaborating on a project with more experienced software developers. I think it would be worthwhile for everyone to get a refresher/intro to the basic git collaboration workflow if we are serious about dedicating ~1/2 our retreat work time to hackathon-ing. I'd be happy to prepare a 1-2 hour session to fill the remaining pre-dinner slot in our schedule if y'all think it would be useful.
arushi: Go Josh!
pfaendtner: The pending grant at NSF on PBMetaD got rejected. #SAD!!!!
pfaendtner: we will resubmit it on September 30
pfaendtner:  NVIDIA will be here on Thursday on campus and they would like to meet with the group to review our GROMACS compilation and benchmarking. Is anyone interested/available to do this? I believe this would need to be an HPCC student (Janani could also come) since only students can run on the GPUs? we have around $90K to spend on nodes in the next 9 months

maneki_neko: You're welcome Luiz :) We will miss you very very much!!
arushi: Important Twitter conversations
pfaendtner: Most people should be using PR barostat once they have equilibrated with Berendesn for projects in this group
anotherjoshsmith: i thought it was PR for equilibration and berendsen for production... :scream:
pfaendtner: :cry:
pfaendtner: PR takes longer to equilibrate and can lead to oscillations but does a better job getting fluctuations right
anotherjoshsmith: jkjkjkjkjk just wondered if saying that would give ya a heart attack

pfaendtner: Does it work?! 
jnnsmpth: I can’t get it to create a new project, so I guess no? Lol.
ldgibson: <missing_message>
sarahalamdari: What do people use in this group besides Mendeley?
sarahalamdari: (just curious)
jnnsmpth: BibTex
cnyambr: Zotero
cnyambr: Mendeley kept crashing for me
pfaendtner: I strongly prefer we find a way to all use the same citation manager 
pfaendtner: Consider that when I write grants with others I basically always have to use Word+EndNote. This is the standard in my experience 
pfaendtner: I am open to using Mendeley and EndNote. I used to use LaTeX but don’t like it that much anymore, but I am also open to being convinced about it 
pfaendtner: This is especially important for people starting  their publishing work with me (eg all except josh Wes ru fu) 
pfaendtner: ldgibson chrisfu we should discuss Campbells Degree of Rate Control sometime _others invited too_   ~also discuss Campbells soup? what flavor?~
pfaendtner: questions for sarahalamdari ldgibson:
1) if I switch to mendeley can I import my whole endnote library?
2) can we have a common PRG mendeley library?
3) is there a reasonably convenient way for me to collaborate w/PIs who are writing papers or grants in word+endnote?
4) what is the meaning of life
ldgibson: 1) There seems to be a way to export all references from EndNote to a `.xml` file that can then be imported into Mendeley
2) As far as I can tell, if we wanted something like that, we would all need a shared directory (like a dropbox or google drive directory) in which we all placed references. I don’t know how sustainable this would be though.
3) It seems like if you are collaborating with someone using EndNote then it will be difficult for you both to add your references. Maybe the solution is just exporting all the references that one party is using, and then sending it to the other so that only 1 person is in charge of editing citations. So it doesn’t seem to me that there _is_ a reasonably convenient way to collaborate, but I’ll keep looking?
4) dogs
pfaendtner: arushi I just retweeted country music legend DollyParton - is this good or bad for our group?

anotherjoshsmith: :ok_hand::skin-tone-3:
jnnsmpth: We’re going to try and do Journal Club tomorrow and the following journals are taken - JCTC, JPCC, JPCB, Langmuir. Off the top of my head, Nature, Science, JACS, PNAS, Angewandte, JCP are up for grabs. The idea is to bring a recent paper from your journal that is of interest (either to  you or to someone else in the group) and talk about it for no more than 2 mins. Then, share the paper on slack (or by email).
jnnsmpth: And by 'bring', I mean share the doi with me and I'll pull it up during group meeting
anotherjoshsmith: I'll take Nature
cnyambr: I call dibs on JACS
wesleybeckner: popular science
pfaendtner: :heart_eyes_cat:
pfaendtner: YASSSSS

Jim has openings for JRT this week, tomorrow and Friday. Sign up at the link above. Thank you.
ldgibson: so I went ahead and put the necessary files for running TeraChem in `/gscratch/pfaendtner/ldgibson/terachem` on Mox. You can copy those files to your directory and then run it with your own coordinates file (xyz or pdb). The input file is pretty clear about what each option means, but I put in some comments for things that might not be immediately obvious. If anything isn’t clear, you can just ping me and maybe I’ll know? Otherwise, you can also check the online manual:  (The list of options is at the very bottom)

Let me know if nothing works and you break Mox and/or Hyak :upside_down_face:
wesleybeckner: thanks luke!

exit 0
```
ldgibson: Gaussian 09 is commented out if you wanna use that one instead
pfaendtner: can I get a tl;dr for using slurm :laughing:
1) how do I submit the file to the scheduler?
2) how do I check my jobs
3) how do I find out what fraction of pfaendtnre nodes are in use?
pfaendtner: :heart_eyes_cat:
ldgibson: submitting a job: `sbatch job.sh` (as long as you specify necessary info (e.g., allocation, partition, mem) in `job.sh`
cancel job: `scancel &lt;job_id&gt;`
your jobs: `squeue -u jpfaendt`
to see current running jobs on our nodes: `hyakalloc pfaendtner`
to see the entire queue of jobs on our nodes: `squeue -p pfaendtner`
ldgibson: also, to check if any nodes are down or idle: `sinfo -p pfaendtner`
pfaendtner: WOW IT WORKED
pfaendtner: :dorothy:
ldgibson: _how do you explain this_
pfaendtner: WOW I’M RUNNING 3 JOBS
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner:  ^ that looks super useful
anotherjoshsmith: HEY Y'ALL!

moved UWPRG/website to UWPRG/UWPRG.github.io... plz clone the latter for future changes to the website. if you currently have a local copy of `UWPRG/website`, delete it and clone `UWPRG/UWPRG.github.io` instead. if you have local changes that haven't been committed and pushed to github, DM me for help getting those added to the new repository.
pfaendtner: It is happening!!  UW IT is going to forward the new URL
pfaendtner: Josh if I want to request changes that I don’t know how to make do I just do an issue?
pfaendtner: One issue per change ?
anotherjoshsmith: Yeah just post issues and assign them to someone else (probably me for now). Whether you post one issue or several issues depends on how big/related the changes are. I think it's probably better to err on the side of posting a lot of small issues
jnnsmpth: ordering office supplies tomorrow; slack me if you need anything
pfaendtner: corrected my picture on new group website, do you guys approve?
pfaendtner: I don’t think it needed a PR hope that is OK :stuck_out_tongue:

pfaendtner: Hi Jim,

My apologies for the long delay in responding to this request. I am pleased to inform you that the department will cover the cost of remodeling B017, essentially as described in the bulk of your email. This remodel is performed with the understanding that the department will retain the right to assign desks in B017 to graduate students in need of office space should your group size decrease significantly.

Kameron will be in touch to inform you and your students of the work schedule.
pfaendtner: B17 is going to get REDID!!! wesleybeckner anotherjoshsmith arushi cnyambr coco @anyoneelsewhositsintherethatImissed
maneki_neko: pfaendtner Something is wrong with my UW ID. Basically it works for bus and purchases but I don't have any account for IT services? If I try to print the system tells me I don't have authorization. :shrug:

pfaendtner: Chris^3
cnyambr: Congrats, Chris!!
ksakloth: congrats!
chrisfu: Thanks everyone!
anotherjoshsmith: Gooo chrisfu !!! 
sarahalamdari: Is there a format for paper updates this Tuesday? I don’t remember if we talked about it last week
arushi: ya, is there?
pfaendtner: jnnsmpth ? :slightly_smiling_face:
pfaendtner: They are very short. I would focus on:
1) present the title of the paper and the key points from the abstract (i.e., overall goal/hypothesis and results) as they stand today
2) key figures / data / status of data collection
3) bottlenecks to finishing the paper and timeline
jnnsmpth: I’m copying what Jim wanted from us during group retreat -
Research update talks:
Present a concise research update of the next paper you will publish. I would like to see an title of the paper, an outline and current tables and figures in the best quality possible given available time as well as a list/description of other major figures/tables. Also please include the following in your talk:

* a list of major conclusions
* a list of major hurdles between you and giving me a final 1st draft of the publication
* a “best case scenario timeline” and several “potential pitfalls or redundant approaches” (anticipate things that might go wrong and what you will do to remedy the situation).
jnnsmpth: !
pfaendtner: I think jill gonna make :cookie: for u guys
arushi: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: that looks like a lovely article!
pfaendtner:  I have a hard stop of 4:30 pm today, I suggest pre-loading the talks onto one laptop
jnnsmpth: You can send your presentations to me before group meeting!
wesleybeckner: Hey guys. I’m feeling more and more nauseous as the day goes on. I’ve added my slides to the group folder but I don’t think I’ll make it to GM. 
arushi: TAKE CARE WES
sarahalamdari: feel bettta!!
pfaendtner: There are anti nausea meds
pfaendtner: But feel better :stuck_out_tongue::stuck_out_tongue::stuck_out_tongue:

wesleybeckner: Avoided the pukes :sweat_smile: and feelin betta’
pfaendtner:  If anyone is around Monday after seminar, I’d like to invite you to join me for a drink. This seminar is about me making the case to the faculty that I deserve to be promoted to Full Prof (_still in process and TBD this Spring_).  The idea that could happen without such an awesome group is ridiculous. I would be nothing without the team I do research with.

So I will go to college inn and raise a pint for all PRGs past and present, and I would be happy to have you with me. (It is CIP so 21+. Sorry!)
pfaendtner: Please let me know if you are coming :) 
sarahalamdari: woo (pre) congrats jim!! will be there

pfaendtner: we did this with Pratyush 3+ years ago and it was really great
anotherjoshsmith: Looks like the learning curve could be pretty steep if we didn't bring someone out.
anotherjoshsmith: Could be worth it if we want to push more of our workflow to Python
pfaendtner: Jill just killed a Yellowjacket Queen flying around our house.  Anyone care to guess what I shouted when she did ? 
coco: Is that so called bumblebee?
pfaendtner: naw bumblebee is a car that can talk like a human :man-shrugging::skin-tone-4:
pfaendtner:  half of a chocolate bourbon pecan pie in the fridge in the grad lounge. Go get em.

I'm sure Matthew will have great advice about getting started with `dask`!

pfaendtner: Guys zoom in on Fig 1
pfaendtner: #1 this is hilarious
pfaendtner: #2 this paper cites 4 federal grants and it is _possible_ that this could be viewed as research misconduct
pfaendtner: #3 the 1st author is a postdoc from UW who does not have the protections of tenure or academic freedom
sarahalamdari: Lol was the poop image really necessary
pfaendtner: no did you zoom way in
pfaendtner: there is a secret message in the poop
sarahalamdari: no hahaha
sarahalamdari: wait I’m zooming in on poop in a public coffee shop, is there really a hidden message
sarahalamdari: I feel like there isn’t and now I look crazy
pfaendtner: honest
pfaendtner: it is worth it
sarahalamdari: haha saw it
sarahalamdari: 10/10
jnnsmpth: HAhahaha

pfaendtner: Anyone interested in helping to review this paper:

Title : “Enhanced sampling of transition states”
Author(s): Debnath, Jayashrita; Invernizzi, Michele; Parrinello, Michele
ldgibson: Sure! Sounds like a good one
pfaendtner: wow the new mighty mouse doesn’t need batteries :heart_eyes_cat:

pfaendtner: :thinking_face:
ldgibson: &gt; The research in this group is so _cat heart eyes_
pfaendtner: ^^^ PERFEC

chris.mundy: In momentum space, no one can hear me scream, that is
chris.mundy: fftw hayak…  Any ideas?
chris.mundy: Does this belong on personaldevelopment?
chris.mundy: or random?
chris.mundy: or fftw… Did I mention I need this?:wink:
pfaendtner: chris.mundy are you using intel compiler? I think it is buried in there somewhere
pfaendtner: I have compiled it myself a billion times for gnu

chris.mundy: :joy:
pfaendtner: I’m checking w/UWIT real quick - will let you know , if not I can cmopile it
pfaendtner: you need the double precision version right?
pfaendtner: we use the single prec for gromax
chris.mundy: No  don’t waste time… I can do it.., double is what I use…
pfaendtner: it is pretty easier for either of us
pfaendtner: _configure_ ; _make install_
chris.mundy: Agreed.  It takes a villiage
pfaendtner: it will take a village to impeach It
pfaendtner:  will someone meet Uber Eats driver in the alley to pickup cookies for josh’s practice talk

ldgibson: , I’ll be giving a small tutorial today for sabiha3 and cmashraf on using Gaussian in the context of reactions (e.g., finding transition states), but will also cover some things that most people would be able to apply to their research at one point or another. React to this message if you’re interested in joining. Right now, I’ve reserved the blue room from 3:30-5pm for this.

maneki_neko: Do you guys have snow too?
maneki_neko: We got like an inch but it didn't stick well to the roads ... But I bet it's going to be dangerously icy.
k1liu: Will the snow last for a week?
pfaendtner: With the low temperature forecast it could last a few days.  The ground temperature is above freezing so it will mostly melt.  More snow could happen later in the week too.

pfaendtner: What’s the deal with people using ground floor bathroom. Not shutting the door?
sarahalamdari: Omg lol. Don’t get us started. 
jnnsmpth: :joy:
anotherjoshsmith: Kind of a weird setup with 3 toilets. Might confuse a random passerby
sarahalamdari: Is it still confusing after you put signs up all over the bathroom, hmm!!
sarahalamdari: Sorry I’m riled now
anotherjoshsmith: Nah that’s probably just people protesting the sign :joy:
pfaendtner: I have time for meetings today if people are coming in 
pfaendtner: sarahalamdari I saw so many signs!! And then this cat is just doing his thing in the stall with the door wide open 
anotherjoshsmith: omg for a split second i pictured an actual cat in the bathroom
anotherjoshsmith: now that's your problem. cats can't read!
sarahalamdari: It’s becoming a real problem :woman-facepalming:
pfaendtner: seriously tho. what are plausible hypotheses that explain this behavior?
anotherjoshsmith: :troll:
jnnsmpth: Maybe the sign needs to be more specific, like 'lock the main bathroom door' or something.
It's not immediately obvious for someone new that 1 person uses the whole bathroom at once.
ldgibson: or the present day American education system isn’t teaching kids to read anymore
pfaendtner: Yeah like maybe they are just locking the stall door

sarahalamdari: Alternate visit w/ prospective grad student Megan english got pushed  because of the snow! Sabiha or I will let yall know when they reschedule!
arushi: anyone having trouble with lolo?
Josh and I are getting `permission denied` if we try to copy files from lolo to hyak, or untar the file on lolo into a folder on hyak
anotherjoshsmith: snowpocalypse. everyone back up your files before the snow gets to them!
k1liu: yeah, i move all of my file to the directory ‘California’.
pfaendtner:  Jake Boes (faculty candidate) is visiting Monday. He does DFT / catalysis / machine learning. We may have a need for a grad student host/escort - is there someone who wants to do this?
sashby:  - Boes escorts resolved. Thanks, everyone, and enjoy the snow!

coco: In which parallel world you get negative distance with plumed? :thinking_face:
coco: Has anyone had this before? Getting negative  distance with plume d?
anotherjoshsmith: What CV are you using?
coco: distance between surface and peptide.. I am checking if my reference atom has traveled  across the pbc wall … but I don’t understand why it could be negative
coco: its DISTANCE COMPONENTS NOPBC
prelj: When using COMPONENTS in addition to DISTANCE, the measurement is different, and no longer uses absolute value. You can toggle between negative and positive distances by switching the order of items A and B you are measuring the distance between. The distance from A to B is the negative of distance from B to A, when using components. This is not the case if only DISTANCE is invoked, in which case absolute value is used and it seems to always be positive
coco: Thx! problem solved!
jnnsmpth: We’re outside!

pfaendtner: silicatein mimic peptide adsorbing to AWI
pfaendtner:  I got some questions about concepts at group meeting I wanted to answer
pfaendtner: 1) What is parallel tempering?

PT is a sub-class of methods called “replica exchange”.  The idea is to overcome energy barriers that limit exploration of phase space.  You have a set of N non-interacting simulation replicas that are spaced apart in temperature (the spacing of T1-T2, etc matters. it is not linear).  And you attempt exchanges in configurations so the system goes up and down in T like a random walk
pfaendtner:  here is a lecture from our friend massimiliano.bonomi , we gave this workshp in Uruguay 7 years ago
pfaendtner: 2) What is a WTM bias?

WTM = well-tempered metadynamics.  I think you mean ‘WTE bias’ but I’m not sure.  This question followed the PT one, so I think you are asking what we are doing on top of PT in order to increase sampling.  In any case, the bias is an additional potential added to the system to achieve improvements in sampling. This is very generic because it can be done in many different ways.
pfaendtner:  Here is a lecture from our friend Giovanni Bussi about metadynamics and WTM
pfaendtner: 3) What is a hill height?

A “hill” here means a Gaussian function. The metadynamics bias is summation of Gaussians. and this is what the height refers to. We call them ‘hills’ because they look like a little hill when you plot them.  You can learn more in the ^ movie
pfaendtner: 4) What is the bias potential?

We refer to any additional function added to an MD calculation that is not related to the molecular energy/forces as a ‘bias potential’. This comes in many forms:  a restraining potential keeping you away from certain parts of the simulation box or holding you exactly in one spot, or a potential like the metadynamics potential that is time-dependent
pfaendtner: You can see a nice introduction to bias potentials here in the video from our friend Gareth:  
pfaendtner: Gareth has a very pleasant voice
pfaendtner: 5) How does the neural network replace back-propagation?

:man-shrugging::skin-tone-4: cmashraf anotherjoshsmith wesleybeckner ldgibson please answer
pfaendtner: 6) How do you control for over training?

This is the “bias variance tradeoff” that is prevalent in any type of regression.  This video is _ok_ but not great.  The practical answer to your Q is that you have to do a good job reserving “test” data and evaluating your model against it so that you know you can do an OK job even on data your model hasn’t seen…


cmashraf: About (5), actually it is _automatic differentiation_ which might replace back-propagation. A good overview of the difference between these two can be found at ``

He is visiting the Xiaosong Li group, but would like to meet with people from our lab.  ldgibson sabiha3 sarahalamdari jnnsmpth prelj tludwig8 orion.dollar yy6linda coco k1liu can you guys please go to the meeting? It will be a good networking opportunity and practice giving elevator pitches for your work.

Meeting is going to be 1:30-2:30 tomorrow and planned location is the theory conference room in Bagley.  prelj or tludwig8 can lead the way over there. I will notify if there are any changes to location.

Please respond w/:thumbsup::skin-tone-4:  if you are able to attend.

pfaendtner: Feel better soon! 
prelj: I will attend the Jian Liu talk, although I am in office hours (right next door to Bag 319, coincidentally) right up until 1:30. So I won't be there to "lead the charge" over, but I'll see you all there!
sabiha3: I am completely lost!
sabiha3: I found 318, 320
sabiha3: But where is 319?
ldgibson: Other side of building
anotherjoshsmith: Maybe you have to run really fast into the wall between the doors for 318 and 320. Harry Potter style.
coco: For those who didn’t come to Bagley and is interested: 
ldgibson: tl;dr - thermostats are bad, we fixed them, now they good
coco: It’s free and good. Try it.
prelj: For real though, surprisingly trivial manipulations in *when* the temperature is updated relative to the positions and momenta being updated has a HUGE impact, and one variant they particularly like permits large time steps to be chosen without sacrificing accuracy. Sometimes 5-10 fold larger times steps can be used, depending on the system! Simply a new thermostat to use in AMBER, called "Middle". Easy enough to code up yourself, but you don't even have to. Already usable in AMBER, being extended to gromacs and LAMMPS in the near future. Very cool meeting:+1:

orion.dollar: Hey y'all. I'm thinking it could be helpful to dedicate a part of group meeting like once a month or so to reviewing the methods papers that Jim posts or others that might be generally applicable to the group. Wanted to gauge everyone's interest, we could do it in group meeting and incorporate it as part of the schedule or if people prefer it could be an optional thing separate from gm that's more of a show if it applies to you type of thing.

sarahalamdari: Starting to tag folks on github (hopefully you start getting emails when I tag you), under issues there is an “issue” labeled INSTRUCTIONS to help get you started. I included branch name suggestions, but obviously feel free to reorganize that (just make sure you are using unique branch names that can be checked out as changes need to be made to that specific FF type”)

*The two big things that will be important for new users are* 1.) Making sure you are working off a branch and *not* master (which will allow you to make a pull request) and 2.) Not approving your own pull requests.

Good luck!
sarahalamdari: Also i think ldgibson is the only one with admin, so he will add you!
sarahalamdari: actually jnnsmpth too
sarahalamdari: Also everyone should star/watch our repo, thats cute.

jnnsmpth:  I’ve updated the group meeting schedule from Jul 24 - Sept 25. Each grad student + postdoc will present twice, undergrads will present once, and rotating students will also give a short presentation :slightly_smiling_face:
Mentors should make sure that mentees are ready with their presentations on the designated date, and if they can’t make it to group meeting, mentors may present on their behalf.
Please let me know if you don’t have access to PRG calendar.
Group meetings are not at the same time every week (I’ll send a notification on the morning of group meeting).
pfaendtner: jnnsmpth thank you very much.  I expect you to give group meeting when assigned and keep swapping or canceling to a minimum.  I realize it is unavoidable sometimes. But not being ready is not a great reason. At the retreat I offered to write a short doc on “three types of PRG group meeting presentations” and provide some guidelines (if people wanted this). Someone just please ask for it if you do.  It would be helpful if you self-identified the type of group meeting you were going to give.  

Finally. On days when we have three talks, I will be dividing the presentation time equally or at least verifying everyone has access to the same amount of time.  We have been having a little bit of drift with Talk 1 being the longest and talk 3 being the shortest. If you don’t plan for how you will use your time, it is sometimes the case that things go longer than you expect.  This is ok sometimes, but we are having some drift in this direction...
pfaendtner:   <!channel> looks like an interesting read and maybe group meeting presentation
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner:  As you know I will be gone almost 3/4 of the next weeks. I’ll be back in the lab next Wed-Fri and look forward to hearing updates on your research. Sometime near the end of next week (all PRGs on payroll) can expect a request from me for a short “work plan” for the time period covering Aug 5-18 with expected work and deliverables and a subsequent follow up after the 18th to see how things go.

This will just be a short paragraph with some bullet points. Please don’t send anything yet but be prepared for ~1 day turnaround next week.

Reminder that when I am traveling out of the office the same expectations for your attendance at work apply.
pfaendtner: Hey MD people - Josh’s PBUT paper in the Google Drive is a great example of effective way to write intro and methods for your own studies.

pfaendtner: Also actual picture of me today:
jnnsmpth:  group meeting schedule has been updated for the next quarter, from Oct 2 - Dec 17. If you have conflicts, please try resolving it first by exchanging dates with other members, and if that's not feasible, let me know. The schedule is tight given that we do not have regular group meetings on Oct 23 (we have a visiting postdoc) and Nov 13 (AIChE). Also, we have 4 members presenting on Oct 2, Nov 7, Dec 17 so we really need to keep time on these days!
pfaendtner:  new rule this quarter: you are on a fixed timetable when you speak. We are having too many people go over their time and this is not fair to the people who are going last. Janani is going to be buying a digital timer which will have your available time.  Unless it is a special case and you have arranged it with me and the group manager _in advance_ , you may not go over this time. If you want to get time from other people, ask us — not the other person who is speaking.

when the timer goes off your group meeting is 100% over and you have to stop talking.  The best way to avoid this is to practice your group meeting in advance and plan your time so you can get the most out of it.

Sorry to have to make a rule like this, but things are getting a little out of hand

pfaendtner: A family of algorithms for interpreting manifold embedding coordinates in molecular dynamics data

We present a method for analyzing low-energy paths between molecular conformations by combining techniques in both manifold learning, which identifies such paths, and functional regression, which can parameterize them by explanatory non-linear functions. Unsupervised manifold learning approaches are useful for understanding molecular dynamics simulations since they disregard small-scale information such as peripheral hydrogen vibrations that can nevertheless drastically affect the observed energy. However, understanding the role of covariates such as bond rotation in determining the energy landscape is made difficult by non-trivial data topology and geometry. In order to deal with these difficulties, we regress gradients of embedding coordinates on functional covariate gradients, and use a group-lasso inspired penalty for inducing sparsity. Differentiation of functional covariates is done automatically, while embedding gradients are estimated. This method replaces visual inspection for determining which bonds describe the slow dynamical modes of small molecules.

Also please know that snacks and coffee at exams are not required and if you don’t feel like doing it, that is also fine.
ldgibson: anyone going to that “Calling BS” seminar talk today at 12:30?
rhodese: pfaendtner This exam policy counts for undergrads too, right? Seniors technically have two exams this week... 
pfaendtner: ^^ OK this is fine but we are going to replace that with an exam of the style grad students take.  You + 3 professors and a white board for 2 hours
pfaendtner: We will ask you whatever we want about the subject matter and check our email
sarahalamdari: haha omg
maneki_neko: If you can get 3 professors to deal with me 2 hours, multiple times this week, I will absolutely do it for the cookies.
maneki_neko: Can I get imported snacks too??
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
lemmoi: This is a big flex but it's really exciting, Stan Wittingham is the guy my dad did his post doc with!!
jnnsmpth: We have 4 presentations today, so we're going to start group meeting at 4:00 pm on the dot. The order of presenters is cmashraf, orion.dollar, ldgibson, Janani. Those of you presenting, please send me your slides so we minimize transition time.
jnnsmpth: Each presenter gets 22 mins.
pfaendtner: thanks Janani!
pfaendtner: ldgibson here is the Na-Cl FES from PB MetaD when you just look at the distance CV directly. Note how the FE goes down as you go out in distance - weird
pfaendtner: Here is the same data but the correction is added - it is FES - 2*kT*ln(distance)
pfaendtner: but now I’m confused about what units the distance are in why can you just take ln(distance) chris.mundy :cry:
chris.mundy: rigid rotor.  Difference between reversible work and helmoltz free energy.  Without the correction Entropy is killing you.
chris.mundy: remember ln g(r) = W(r).  g(r) is normalised by 4*pi* r^2.  Take a ln of that you get 2 ln r.
chris.mundy: It all makes sense.
chris.mundy: Helmoltz free energy is not the same as W(r).  This is tricky.
chris.mundy: Did I understand your concerns correctly?  I think it makes sense.  Exploding head should be a dancing banana!
chris.mundy: Not to be overly padandic:  if you put two atoms in a big simulation box (even with a strong attaction), the equilibrium state will be for them to be apart.  Entropy wins.  That is what  Helmoltz says.  To get the PMF/W(r) @ you “subtract” out the this rigid rotor term to get rid of this purely entropic term.
prelj: Hi PRG, requesting some feedback: James and I are preparing a poster to bring to the grad recruiting poster session through the chemistry department next Thursday. We wanted to provide a broad overview of the very different types of science going on in our group, and so rather than covering a particular application we are focused more generally on the techniques. I think we do a good job of covering both the small atomistic length scales, coarse grained / system of equations large length scales, as well as special analysis techniques like clustering, summarizing all of our works in a big-picture way.

We have a draft put together, but there are a couple of things we are unsure of: Have we listed funding sources correctly? We need grant numbers (where can we get these?) and thanks to Hyak still in acknowledgements. In what order should we list authors? Do you feel any blurbs or explanations are required in a section related to your work such that it is not misrepresented? We have chosen to omit the traditional Abstract, Background, Future Work, etc. type information, because individual projects are not the focus here. We will be beside the poster for the duration. Is this appropriate?

We will ensure panels are evenly spaced from one another and images are centered at the end, once we are sure that things will not change dramatically. We appreciate any comments!

pfaendtner:  ^^ please help Team :rocket:
pfaendtner: Gave a really fun seminar on our SBP work today at U Nebraska, Lincoln - as soon as I get to a fast internet connection the slides will update in the google drive for PRG.  I reformulated how I talk about the work , so you might be interested to take a look
pfaendtner: prelj tludwig8: you dont need grant numbers , and the authors can just go alphabetical // you might also look @ my SBP talk if you want some specific ideas about how I talk about various projects…
pfaendtner: I’m seeing lots of bug reports about the new MacOS (Catalina). Please wait until next stable release for updates to your work computers 
davidcj: I already did and it really messed up my Anaconda
davidcj: 0/10
davidcj: would not reccomend updating work computers
maneki_neko: The last time I updated my lab computer I couldn't print anymore :cold_sweat: 10/10 agree don't update
ldgibson:  can you let me know if you published (or know of) work with ML that used Hyak? I looked through Jim’s google scholar and only found Wesley’s fantastic liquids paper that actually acknowledges Hyak. Thanks!
sabiha3: I think most of them are on AWS 
pfaendtner: Joshs langmuir paper 
pfaendtner: But maybe that didn’t use hyak 
ldgibson: ok cool, I’ll pull that one up and check - thanks!
pfaendtner: is anyone using the biorender subscription? prelj sarahalamdari @anyone ?
sarahalamdari: Not at the moment, also was it a trial? I got logged out 
prelj: No I haven't had the need for it despite making many figures lately. It's all VMD and python:man-shrugging: Freeware goes a long way
pfaendtner:  5th postdoc, Stephanie Hare, will start April 15!
jnnsmpth: 🥳 
maneki_neko: Can we also expect a Dr. Rabbit soon?? :rabbit:
sabiha3: <missing_message>
sarahalamdari: This energy correction for calculating pmf from simulation box just blew my mind
sarahalamdari: that is cray.
cmashraf:  We will have a guest speaker from MIT for next week's group meeting, attached is his bio and talk abstract. Please note that it will be held at *NanoES 291 from 11am-noon* on Oct 23rd

pfaendtner: rhodese 
rhodese: As a 60 year old, what was it like to be a teenager in the 70s?
pfaendtner: :laughing:
pfaendtner: just like to point out that when I was 33 someone guess I was 42 and when I was 40 someone guess I was 60
ldgibson:  we are over quota on storage on mox
sarahalamdari: pfaendtner can we purchase more storage? I can do it, 10TB is not sustainable when IKT dies…
sarahalamdari: For ref we currently have 36TB on ikt
pfaendtner: we can probably purchase more storage but I need someone to figure it out w/Nam
pfaendtner: we also need to clean up our files
pfaendtner: that 36TB on ikt could literally evaporate any moment
sarahalamdari: I can do that
cmashraf:  just a reminder, group meeting today at 11 in 291 NanoES
pfaendtner:  Because of upcoming travel, unboarding new ATC, AIChE, and fall business I’m sorry I haven’t been able to meet recently. This is probably going to continue until week of November 18.
pfaendtner: In the meantime feel free to slack me research updates or email me longer updates , ask questions, etc.
pfaendtner: I have been doing meetings with some people where needed to advance experimental collaborations and grants, and I’m also happy to try and squeeze you in if there are specific things to discuss that you need a bit of face time and slack wont due
pfaendtner: I’ll do my best!
davidcj: weird chlorine smell coming from vents in Benson 236 and 2nd floor in general. I've got a booth in MolES if anyone needs a solid place to work outside of Benson for a bit.
pfaendtner: did you tell Kameron? please do so asap
davidcj: Yeah he's on it
cnyambr: Hey, , I'm giving a practice talk for my first conference talk tomorrow in Nance lab meeting in Benson 109 from 12-1:30 pm. You don't have to be there the whole time, I'll be presenting first so I would appreciate if you could come and provide feedback on my MD and experimental section. My talk is 12 minutes with 3 minutes Q&amp;A. My audience should be people who are familiar with computational methods but they'll be some experimentalists in the audience
cnyambr: Thanks in advance!
ldgibson:  The RCC club is submitting an STF proposal to replace the STF nodes being lost on ikt with new mox nodes. Please take a moment to endorse the proposal! You just need to click the “Endorsements” tab at the top and write a quick endorsement. Thanks! <https://uwstf.org/proposals/2020/21>
cmashraf: I am leaving early, my wife is suddenly feeling very sick.
pfaendtner: oh no, take care!
pfaendtner:  notes:

1) I updated the best practices word doc in the publication folder on PRG shared
2) I added a spot for posters.  Please put your posters there. There is a community one for group posters
3) Hi
pfaendtner:  I put updated versions of the UW branded templates in 4:3 and 16:9 format - you should use these for your talks if you want to use the UW template.  Note you should not take the 4:3 template then converte the slide size to 16;9 it will deform the logos in an ugly way
sarahalamdari: Going to a neat seminar today if anyone wants to come!

sabiha3: Hi all, what is the newest plumed we have compiled? The one Chris Fu compiled is pretty old, it is recommending old lammps for the patch.
pfaendtner: We should have a new one on hand - it is also very easy to compile 
sabiha3: I'll compile the newest one if no one has it already.
pfaendtner: Sabiha (and everyone)  make sure you use a consistent version of md engine and plumed for a whole project. So you might wind up rerunning your first round of sims to get a new version, etc.   

Only switch versions between papers 
pfaendtner: Technology question: how can we put a camera on or near the tv in my office (it is connected to Apple TV) for use with zoom 
prelj: Webcam that clips to the top of the TV?
pfaendtner: ^^ are you volunteering to figure this out for your dummy boss :heart_eyes_cat:
prelj: lol sure, I'll check out some webcam models. Dave Ginger also uses a tabletop mic in the middle of the room so everybody can be heard when speaking, which I liked
pfaendtner:  do you all know there is a channel called <#C0LDSJ9CL|jobs>  ?
maneki_neko: Yes
davidcj: I did not.
sarahalamdari: does anyone know the password for wes old comp? wesleybeckner
ldgibson: Another reminder  to endorse the RCC STF proposal for 64 new nodes on mox (replacing nodes lost on itk) if you haven’t already! <https://uwstf.org/proposals/2020/21>
maneki_neko: I got word from Wes
maneki_neko: I've got some passwords to try out, but I will accept any suggestions as backup
pfaendtner: This guy Saber’s seminar is going to be so awesome - he has this wild next gen force field Thursday, November 7, 2019 102 Chemistry Building, 1:00 pm

xqi: Hey guys! A couple people have asked me about questions related to how force fields describe interfacial interactions between metals and solution phase molecules and also about crystal growth mechanisms. I’m thinking about giving a 30 min talk + Q&amp;A during a group meeting next semester, for example, early January, sharing about what I have learned re: those topics so far. Topics can include polarizable force fields, solid surface and growth kinetics, bulk and surface behaviors of solid material, and so on. Some questions from you guys will greatly help me putting together topics for the talk — I would really appreciate it! Please slack me with any questions you might have (can be related to any thing). Thank you!

pfaendtner: Any PRGs who are nonnative speakers interested in working through some English grammar lessons online? My brother in law has developed an online format for a series of textbooks he publishes (). Let me know if you are interested in trying it out we can get you a free account while they are continuing to build the site and debug.  
pfaendtner: Also native speakers might want to try it who want to improve their grammar and writing.

cmashraf: Sure I will
ldgibson: If anyone is running Gaussian 16 on Hyak, I have written this script that lets you convert the `*.log` file to an `*.xyz` file so it can be quickly visualized in VMD. Can take both `opt` and `scan` jobs, and also records the energies (in Hartrees) in the comment line for the xyz file. Default for an `opt` job is to just take all frames. Only works for Gaussian 16 log files because that’s what I use and apparently it’s a different format than Gaussian 09. Needs to be executable and added to your `PATH` to work optimally. sarahalamdari tludwig8 @anyoneusinggaussianonhyak

It’s not perfect, so let me know if you run into any bugs or weird behavior!


ldgibson: Also threw together that README super fast, so if something isn’t clear from the programmed help message, lemme know
xqi: PRG Group meeting update: the group meeting this Wednesday will be held in *MolES 215*!
pfaendtner: Luke is it 2D or 1D only? 
ldgibson: Like for the scans?
pfaendtner: yas king
ldgibson: It's only for 1D scans right now and it doesn't necessarily track the changing degree of freedom, but it shouldn't be too hard to track it, which should also account for 2D scans
ldgibson: My use case didn't call for more than energy, but a lot can be tracked
ldgibson: With the right grep command, haha
pfaendtner: DO TI
pfaendtner: DO IT

pfaendtner: is entropic binding real and how are we goign to find out?
jnnsmpth: That is the question.
pfaendtner: this is an important science question we need to work on for the center and for our dignity
jnnsmpth: For our dignity. I like that.
pfaendtner: I think we need a research plan about how to tackle this and all work togehter
pfaendtner: and then we can publish a paper called "entropic binding is not real"
sarahalamdari: there is a plan and a squad in place
pfaendtner: maybe I can help?! :slightly_smiling_face:
pfaendtner: also I think shaui and jim could probably track mobility of car9GFP on a surface and we could get trajectories and diffusivities
pfaendtner: which would let us try to get pep surface diffusions :drooling_face:
davidcj: I personally think the term 'entropic binding' is vague and can be misleading

nintan2: Can I take part in this class - i.e. watch how this class being taught?
jnnsmpth: Lecture #7 please! Trajectory analysis.
pfaendtner: Nadia - yes of course but you are also qualified to teach. You have a PhD :) what if sign you up for a later class and then you can come to the earlier ones? 
nintan2: Maybe! Let's see how the earlier ones being taught first- how deep people go etc. I am not sure I have 2 hours knowledge of any of the topic...
pfaendtner: you could do a VASP tutorial if you wanted?
cmashraf: sarahalamdari Parallel computing for me!!
davidcj: This is all making me so excited for these lectures :heart_eyes_cat:

pfaendtner: Just a reminder: you should all be using Mendeley for any work you want to publish me (right now there are only 1 active exceptions to this in the group for).  Mendeley has a nice stand alone app and there is a browser plugin so you can add to your library from a web page you are looking at with 2 steps: 2-3 clicks to add to your Mendeley database in the cloud and 1 click to refresh your local library in your app from the cloud database.

sarahalamdari:  when all the dads team up for a special edition issue
lemmoi: From above:
```It also provides evidence for the growing conviction in the protein structure community that the laws of quantum chemistry are applicable only to small molecules and not to proteins.

This must be why no one does ab initio with proteins :thinking_face:

cmashraf: Prof. Alex Dowling from Notre Dame will be at UW on the 17th of January. His work is in the area of Uncertainty Quantification, Computational Optimization, and Molecular-to-Systems Engineering.

jnnsmpth: Hi all! I'm giving a practice chalk talk today, 1/21 from 2:30 pm - 3:30 pm in Benson 109 to prepare for onsite faculty interviews. Those of you interested in pursuing an academic career might find this useful. I've never attended a chalk talk myself, and it's definitely the most mysterious part of the process. Refreshments will be provided!
davidcj: Aw I have DIRECT class right then :disappointed:
davidcj: Good luck / have fun :slightly_smiling_face:
jnnsmpth: Thanks!
xqi: Hi all! Our group meeting this Wed is cancelled because it coincides with our first faculty candidate seminar. Everyone is highly encouraged to attend the seminar. I’ll post the new schedule for presenters this week (Chowdhury, James and Chris) on the group calendar.
coco: No cookie then.
xqi: Pizzaaaaaa!
xqi: We should have pizza, cheese fries, buffalo wings, chicken figures, etc etc etc for our group meeting :pizza::poultry_leg::croissant::pretzel::pancakes::cheese_wedge::taco:🧆:sandwich::fries: and 🦴🦴🦴
nintan2: i second that!
pfaendtner: I guess Xin falls more on the salty vs sweet category? :joy:
xqi: you are 100% correct!
coco: Typical Chinese tongue :tongue:

xqi: I would be happy to listen to your talk every week :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
cmashraf: I would probably choose the impeachment trial style then :star-struck:
xqi: I changed the second one to Chris. It should be Chris at the first place but i made a mistake. But you can take it back from Chris if you wish :grin:
cmashraf: Great!! Thanks you!!
cmashraf: xqi, sorry to poke you again. Looks like I got rescheduled to Feb 26th, but there is another faculty candidate seminar scheduled for that day. Just to give a heads up.
xqi: I’ll contact Andrea about rescheduling
jnnsmpth:  Final practice chalk talk on Wed, 01/29 from 1-2 in B 109! Jim and Stephanie Valleau are my faculty panelists this time. Emoji this if you can make it. Expect coffee and cookies!
pfaendtner: Let me know if you wanna come to a free CrossFit class with me :joy::joy::joy:
rhodese: When is it?
pfaendtner: sundays
maneki_neko: How many more emojis before that email becomes an MLM facebook post?
dacb: I will only go with you, if your cross fit exercise is to carry me around on your back like this
pfaendtner: _mmmmm carry the dacb i will_ 
pfaendtner: would be easier to carry baby yoda, amirite prelj

pfaendtner: Got invited to an awesome workshop this summer in Telluride. Currently all organizers and confirmed participants are of same gender and gives me concerns about DEI :neutral_face: :neutral_face: so I sent this. It is hard for you all to this while you are trainees or (hopefully soon) non-tenured. But if I can't do it as a full prof and dept. chair then who can?

_Hi everyone,_

_This looks like an awesome meeting and I would love to attend. Before I confirm my attendance, could you please give me a quick update on your plans to encourage gender diversity in the list of speakers/participants? Looking at the link below there is currently 100% male participation, but perhaps this is because the other speakers have not yet been able to confirm._ 

_I really hope I am able to attend - the research is right in my wheelhouse!_

_Best,_

_Jim_
nintan2: you rock, Jim!
jnnsmpth: B 109 in 30 mins! Bagels, banana walnut bread, and coffee - all ready!
coco: Guys I have a TA session today, will be late for group meeting.
prelj: If anybody is going to the Rohit Pappu seminar today (CHB 102 @ 11:30) could you let me know how it is?? Sounds absolutely wild, pertaining to "membrane less organelles"! See Jim's email
xqi:  any one has the group’s black hdmi/vga converter? My memory has broken down :scream:
xqi: prelj I was there, I can tell you some details
cmashraf:  We will be having a postdoc candidate (Aravinda Munasinghe) visiting us on Friday, Feb 14th. Throughout the day, he will meet with different group members as well as present his work in a seminar. The seminar will be held at *9 am on 14th at Benson 109*. Attached are the summary of his talk and the agenda of his visit. Please let me know if you have any questions.
prelj: Nice! I'm glad the seminar is held earlier

pfaendtner: coco orion.dollar davidcj this is the bot for mof papers.  Can we easily port this to “CoMSEF papers”? How hard? 
davidcj: On sight it seems pretty usable. I'm trying to figure out exactly what information the software is monitoring so it knows what/when to tweet. Is there a specific list of authors or batch of journals under the CoMSEF umbrella?
sarahalamdari: wow cool new paper out :wink: 
ldgibson: can't really trust that author though
maneki_neko: Probably from some group where they only serve mochi ice cream at group meetings
sarahalamdari: omg. i miss mochi ice cream.
maneki_neko: please no, sarah
maneki_neko: spare me

prelj: They are explicitly not the same individual alkehflaiowheflkasdhmclia
prelj: When they eventually give the baby a real name, people are gonna be using yoda anyway. :triumph:
xqi: Sorry, individual what :joy:

prelj: I mean, that's the thing. They haven't said a species. Yoda is the name of a single alien, whose species is unknown. The baby from the show is a baby alien of the same species, but a different particular alien whose name, whatever it is, is not yoda
pfaendtner: prelj comon.  Look at that image up there. The image exists so it is clearly from mandalorian.  baby yoda is reflecting old yoda *clearly* foreshadowing what he will grow into
pfaendtner: also. baby yoda uses the force.  yoda uses the force
pfaendtner: also. baby yoda wears a robe.  yoda wears a robe
prelj: &gt;  people wear clothes, babies wear clothes
&gt; human jedi, younglings train as children
&gt; &gt; baby = jedi confirmed??
pfaendtner: baby yoda = yoda jedi , glad we agree

cmashraf: *Reminder: Aravinda's talk is tomorrow, 9 am, at Benson 109*
pfaendtner: @channel after your last interaction with Aravinda, please send me and dacb a DM on slack:

Strengths, areas of concern, do you think he would be a good fit for the group. Project would be half data science and half molecular simulation focus. 

This is for everyone who meets with him or attends the talk. Even if you are new in the group. 
sarahalamdari: c-dog is presenting at e-science next week!
dacb: Oh my word!  People actually read the eScience bulletin!
sarahalamdari: Once a year
dacb: I Command-F for my name and if it isn't there, delete without reading.   That's basically how I deal with all email.
ldgibson: I also do that for emails with your name too
jnnsmpth: Mendeley breaks when you try to edit things on google docs ~drive~! Beware.
pfaendtner: ^^^ do you mean open them in ?Google Docs?
pfaendtner: I had no problem using google drive for my AI grant, but when someone opened it in google doc it hosed the whole thing
pfaendtner: anyone have recommendation for good restaurant in the ID?
nintan2: what ID stands for? Idaho? India?
cmashraf: International District?
pfaendtner: Yes ID ^^^^
tludwig8: Oh! Has anyone else been to dough zone???


This is one of Taylor's and my favorite places!:)
sarahalamdari: i want to go to there
tludwig8: It's amazing! I would say it was tricky for us with a large group if everyone has different eating preferences/restrictions, but it is great if people are down to eat anything or share preferences (or just go alone and eat all the food:sunglasses:)
pfaendtner: This bar i am at is so skeezy. the bartender has a remote control buzzer to let ppl into the bathroom :grimacing::expressionless:
coco: dough zone is really good:thumbsup_all::thumbsup_all::thumbsup_all:
coco: much better than ding tai fung
pfaendtner: :open_mouth::open_mouth::open_mouth::open_mouth:
tludwig8: We went tonight to celebrate...so good you guys :sob::confetti_ball:
pfaendtner:  do you believe the amino acid binding energy can converge in 300 ps :neutral_face:
jnnsmpth: They’re not even trying.  
sarahalamdari: lol what is going on in that image 
prelj: Maybe they just used 1000 walkers for an effective 300 ns trajectory :bulb:
pfaendtner: it is maybe AIMD
pfaendtner: but still
pfaendtner: janani it is from the paper I sent you this AM
jnnsmpth: Yup, I recognized that. I think they had 1 binding-unbinding event over 300ps.
chris.mundy: Its metadynamics. I am 100% certain.
chris.mundy: :wink:
pfaendtner: :open_mouth:
ldgibson: :upside_down_face:
pfaendtner:  is there an SOP or best practices for doing PTMetaD-WTE

pfaendtner: xqi do we have an extra laptop for Nadia?
prelj: Since getting my own macbook back in December, I have a laptop from PRG in my possession that I am not using. nintan2 swing by whenever and I'll show you. You'll probably want to upgrade in time, but it's functional
nintan2: I got mine fixed, good as new!
pfaendtner:  Kristin Persson (4/23) and Victor Zavala (4/30) are coming for CEI seminars. There is a chance for breakfast with them (up to 2 of you for each)
pfaendtner: both amazing ppl
xqi: :woman-raising-hand:
xqi: if ther’s a place for me
jnnsmpth: Kristin Persson please!
pfaendtner: OK Nadia, Janani and Xin for Persson
pfaendtner: who wants Zavala
pfaendtner: he is more systems / data science
pfaendtner: xqi please email Madison Weaver and Andrea and let them know you are coordinating the breakfast with Persson.  If CEI wont' reimburse beyond just 1 person I will reimburse the rest.   Please wait until we know who is point on Zavala so you can sahre it all.
nintan2: xqi I am out for Persson! Sorry!
sarahalamdari: lol can i replace nadia . :joy:
sarahalamdari: ya’ll quick
xqi: haha sure!
cmashraf: Count me in for Zavala
xqi: nintan2 are you down for Zavala then?
nintan2: sure
xqi: so we have 2 for Zavala and 3 for Persson. Who will be coordinating the breakfast with Zavala?
xqi: Once we decide, I’ll email these info together to Madison and Andrea
nintan2: I can do that - what do I need to do?
pfaendtner: I would email Madison now. She has instructions already about breakfast. 
xqi:  GM starts at 4:15 today! In NanoES 291!
coco: And we have donut mochi today :doughnut:

xqi: This is a tentative schedule for our spring quarter group meetings. I pretend for now that GM will be held on Tuesday mornings, but that’s not the final decision. So please take a look at it and let me know if you have conflict during that week. Thanks!
xqi: If we decide to go with several sub group meeting, I’ll make new schedules for them and we will not be running this schedule.
pfaendtner: so most of the time Wed AM works for me better than Tue AM
pfaendtner: Benson 109 is usually available but not always
pfaendtner: I guess that is going to cause problems for the UG class schedule?
pfaendtner: actually Wed I am usually free the whole day before 3:30 pm
xqi:  Does 1 pm on Wednesday work for everyone?
nintan2: xqi  yes - speaking for myself...
tludwig8: Jesse and I have chemistry seminar until 1:20, so we could start at 1:30?!:0
xqi: Sure! We can also start at 2 pm. Does 2-3:30 fit in your schedule? pfaendtner
pfaendtner: can that work for the UG scheudle?
xqi: :loudspeaker:  particularly undergrads: does Wednesday 2 - 3:30 group meeting fit in your schedule?
lemmoi: xqi I have class until 2:30, but nothing after that
lemmoi: But missing the first 30min is fine with me to make that work for Jim and be done by 3:30
lemmoi: At least for juniors, the class we all take is 12:30-1:30 MWF, with lab all of Tuesday morning (?) depending on which lab they take. I think the when2meet is a good idea because it gets complicated fast
wxq910: I have a class from 230 to 350 on Wed and Fri:sweat_smile:
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: this trending hashtag is :fire:
xqi:  We will try group meeting every Wed 2-3:30 pm next quarter. I’ll see what I can do with room reservation and make a final announcement later.

(above is joke, molsimplify is not :ok_hand::fire:)
sarahalamdari: avogadro is dead to me
ldgibson: Omg that looks amazing
sarahalamdari: did not get a single error. not a single one.
ldgibson: Just _opening_ avogadro causes it to crash for me sometimes
tludwig8: When you finally build what you think you need in avogadro, but you know saving will crash...
nintan2: if you need to build slab, I found VESTA to be very useful - especially if you have the bulk structure already
coco: avogadro crashes all the time for me
coco: I’d rather use a python code
pfaendtner: I'm listing a bunch of projects on my whiteboard in the office. These are just the ones that tend to be in the forefront of my mind lately.  Do not stress if the thing you are mostly working on is not on there! I often have to prioritize based on connection to funding opportunities, priority of collaborators, etc.  Also this is just a snapshot of one moment on one day...

Just noting this since I know some of you will notice this and inevitably someone will notice a gap.

happy to discuss further!

xqi: Sure. We have extra spots for the next quarter.
xqi: If she wants to share her previous work, I can add one for that around May, and another one towards the end
xqi: I’ve received a couple requests for giving extra GM presentation lately. The TBD slots will be “upon request”. We can decide as we go through the quarter.

pfaendtner:  just checkin in on ya'll , I know you continue to get lots of spam from ChemE chair and UW leadership. Take care of yourselves and reach out if you are having a hard time dealing.

Personally I am having trouble focusing on work because of the high volume of stuff coming across my email and tendency to keep looking @ C19 news ...
maneki_neko: Bellevue is surprisingly okay. :raising_hand:

Bring a drink A or N/A of your choice and we will do a round robin and talk about how we are doing and get some encouragement.  

Andrea and I will be setting up individual zoom meetings this week. UG are exempt but welcome to also setup one with your grad mentor.

pfaendtner: My guess is that PRG is going to be all virtual for next two weeks at least. We will discuss today but let’s think of some housekeeping things we can do while it is hard to focus on research:

Help coco and dAve finish twitter bot 
Help Orion and Janani on website 
Other stuff 


pfaendtner: We got this! 

Finally, if you are coming into the lab. I want a desk between all of you. No close contact at whiteboards (6 feet apart) and just let me know.

pfaendtner:  I am going to be asking for two week work plans from all of you who are employed by me or on fellowship and working under my supervision. I think this will be useful in helping you set some modest goals for your work during this difficult time. If you want input on what the plan will look like then today by 3pm you should make suggestions to the draft document that is in the google drive / research. [_edit: turn on 'suggestion mode' when making changes and do not modify the doc directly_]

Undergrads, or students who are not employed, this is totally optional for you and you should feel free to do it as well.

Co-advised people, DM me if you are not sure if you should do this

I will send an email to prg-list with instructions later today.
chris.mundy: I think this is a good idea.  If I may ask the people who I am connected with to add a CJM section.
chris.mundy: It can be:  Nothing.  I think that guy is nuts.,
chris.mundy: But, then I know what I need to do!
chris.mundy: Thank you
pfaendtner: chris.mundy, do you want them to have a section on their work with you and next steps?  Also are you on our group google drive and do you want to be?
chris.mundy: I think it will be helpful for me.  There seem to be infinte projects.  The folks I am most keen on hearing from are (not in any specific order)
chris.mundy: 1.  Jesse P
chris.mundy: 2. Janani S.
chris.mundy: 3. Orion/Sarah
chris.mundy: 4. Luke (but I am slacking him like a fiend and know what is is thinking at any moment.  Example: “Hmmm, I need coffee”  Right?
chris.mundy: Turnabout is fair play, I will also tell them them what I am doing /thinking.
chris.mundy: Add me to google drive.  I will figure this out.
pfaendtner: xqi can you add mundy?

ldgibson: I'm sorry, I don't really know how to live when people aren't constantly roasting me
jnnsmpth: You can always count on me
prelj: I wrote two abstracts, one for each of the big projects I'm working on, for upcoming conferences. I'm gonna pass 'em off to Jim in a few days -- anybody willing to give them a quick read through? Clown face this and I'll go over yours in return :clown_face: I dropped a doc in the PRG Google Drive &gt; Conferences &gt; ACS &gt; JPrelesnik-Abstracts-Draft.docx
cmashraf: Is deadline for ACS 3/30 or 4/20??

sarahalamdari: some travel awards are still 3/30!
cmashraf: oh okay!
pfaendtner:  it seems like a shelter in place order from gov Inslee is imminent. Not sure if for king county or all of wa state. But if you want anything from benson I would go get it today. 
maneki_neko: Stay safe everyone!
nintan2: MANNN!:confounded:
maneki_neko: How is the situation in Seattle though?
coco: ?
chris.mundy: Who is benson?
coco: I am in benson should I leave?
pfaendtner: It’s not guaranteed. I just have it on good advice from outside the UW that ppl are being asked to fill out paperwork for “essential personnel status” 
chris.mundy: Oh, the hall. Got it
pfaendtner: No coco you are fine 
coco: okay
coco: I think benson is very safe no ppl here
pfaendtner: Wait for the governors order. I’m still not :100: convinced he’s going to do it 
chris.mundy: I heard the same through other sources.
nintan2: coco come to second floor if you are bored. there are more people
maneki_neko: #socialdistancing
maneki_neko: Is Seattle a dead zone? Over here everything is basically a ghost town.
maneki_neko: Even the markets barely have people.
coco: <missing_message>
coco: WA is doing a good job… I think the increase is stable
coco: WA
coco: <missing_message>
coco: vs NY
coco: <missing_message>
coco: nintan2 in 20 mins!
pfaendtner: coco I agree - that is why I actually think the gov may just threaten SIP if ppl don't stop going to parks, etc...
pfaendtner: My guess it that it will be a short shelter in place order or no SIP but very stern warnings so that people don't get back to see the cherry blossoms or hang out in the parks in cities.

If they don't do SIP I bet they will close all city parks and start issuing tickets if you violate the social distancing rules
pfaendtner: I saw a bar open last friday and ppl standing in a tight group drinking pints of beer :face_palm::skin-tone-4:
pfaendtner: we also have a much higher ICU bed capacity than rest of country so I think we are in pretty decent shape if things stay as is
coco: there are so many people at quad
pfaendtner: derp
coco: <missing_message>
coco: I took a pic and ran
dacb: That can't be for real. No one is that stupid. Wait... NVM.
pfaendtner: Millie is ready 
nintan2: ready for ...?
davidcj: To defend the homestead
dacb: I can't believe there is no lucille emoji in this slack.
xqi: Michigan’s SIP in effect starting tonight. But per the description, you can still do whatever you’d like besides going to your work place or restaurants.
davidcj: I think stay at home order from Inslee just happened
sarahalamdari: “stay home stay healthy” order :joy: like what
maneki_neko: It did
sarahalamdari: is that what that means?
pfaendtner: Yes. Two weeks minimum 
coco: <missing_message>
cnyambr: can I still go for a run at a park?
dacb: Yes, the order does not cover people going outdoors.  You must still maintain social distance of ~ 6ft.  Inslee said that exercising outdoors is an essential thing.
cnyambr: ok, cool. just wanted to check, honestly wasn't sure
pfaendtner: but if u see coronavirus , you should run away
nintan2: can i camp out at benson? does that count as "staying at home"?:thinking_face:
ldgibson: What if I get my outdoor exercise via larping
sarahalamdari: No gm today? right?
jnnsmpth: No I don't think so
pfaendtner: no but 5pm happy hour check in if ppl want
slackbot: :beer: *slurp* *burp* ヾ(o✪‿✪o)ｼ
pfaendtner: does anyone want that slackbot response to continue - I have to say I kind of dislike it :laughing::laughing::laughing:
maneki_neko: replace it with "blurp surp"
maneki_neko: No wait "blurp surp UwU"
coco: replace it with “wash your hands”
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: ldgibson ^ good zoom background
ldgibson: Oh, perfect, I was halfway done with making my own posing-with-a-tiger-in-a-field background. I can just use that instead!
jnnsmpth: For anyone interested in lipid/membrane biophysics: 
pfaendtner:  no happy hour today , feel free to do your own happy hour or check in if you want to. Instead I want to challenge you all to do something nice for yourself and totally forget about all the shit that is happening. Read a book, watch a show, play a game, etc...

At or around 5pm I'm going to make a double manhattan :cocktail: and dig into some PS4 for a few hours!
slackbot: :beer: *slurp* *burp* ヾ(o✪‿✪o)ｼ
dacb: Animal crossing, pfaendtner?
pfaendtner: I don't have that one :disappointed: :disappointed: :disappointed:
cmashraf: Is it only me that mox takes forever to login?
maneki_neko: I want an AC:NH switch so bad but all that's left are ones from scalpers :sob: all I can do is watch my friend build their islands...
tludwig8: Haha the lite is a pretty great option, that’s what I use and Taylor uses our original switch! Then you could come to our islands too 🥳:ok_hand:
xqi:  We will proceed our group meeting this semester via Zoom until other instructions from the university are in place. The link for Zoom GM is: <https://washington.zoom.us/j/817778389> The link is also available on the group calender.
Just a reminder — we’ve changed our GM time for this semester, they are now every Wednesday 2:00-3:30 pm. The first one is this week on April 1st.
maneki_neko: So what you're saying... Is that it's all a prank and we don't have a meeting on April 1st? ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯
xqi: FYI: it’s not a prank :joy:
pfaendtner:  please join me in congratulating _*PROFESSOR*_ Janani Sampath! Lab opening for business at University of Florida, January 2021.

Or January 2023 if she wants to stay two more years :sunglasses:

We will celebrate in style soon
davidcj: Fantastic!! 
jnnsmpth: :grinning::smiley::sweat_smile::joy: :sob:
lots of emotions!!! Thanks so much PRG, I know I couldn’t have done this without you :heart: 
maneki_neko: !!!!!!!
maneki_neko: That's amazing Janani!!!
coco: just a heads up  I am going to review this paper today:

coco: jim shared it last month.
cnyambr: where is the group meeting zoom link?
tludwig8: It was posted on Monday!
cnyambr: can you post it here again?
tludwig8: <missing_message>
cnyambr: thanks
maneki_neko: I'll be there soon!
maneki_neko: Had to drop mr. Kitty at the vet

coco: <missing_message>
prelj: Can I make a temporary slack channel for force field modification SOP discussion? It seems like many PRG members have useful things to say on the matter and a channel would keep it better organized than &gt;1 chats.
coco: wanna join
pfaendtner: doit :thumbsup::skin-tone-4:  you can add all the relevant ppl who are interested
coco: hey guys
coco: anyone could tell me in what situation that you need a fake file and a --mc flag for reweighting with plumed driver
coco: I had this situation a long time ago and forget the procedure
prelj: Plumed does not know atomic masses by default and they must be provided in an mcfile. I think the way I did it was to run a simulation with a plumed file directive to output the mcfile, which it will do on frame 1. That one mcfile contains the mass information needed for future plumed driver work on a real trajectory of the same atoms
prelj: (I think mc is mass/charge. And these will be needed for plumed driver CVs like radius of gyration that are mass-weighted)
coco: ring a bell!
pfaendtner: prelj amirite
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
prelj: the haircut one oh my lord. it hurts because that was my face every day for years :joy: :cry:
pfaendtner: lol
pfaendtner:  please send me a slack DM when you complete the goals doc
ktorke: Link to the paper I'm gonna talk about at GM today: 
cmashraf: Here is the link of the paper that I am presenting today (Jim sent this one yesterday at )
<https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5099132?journalCode=jcp>
pfaendtner: ere is a link to a great website that prelj might get into: <https://www.instagram.com/babyyodamemes/?hl=en>
prelj: They have merch :sob:
jnnsmpth: Hello?
pfaendtner: wow
sabiha3: What is going on
pfaendtner: is everyone out
jnnsmpth: yes
pfaendtner:  join my personal one 2066168128
maneki_neko: Is something going on?
coco: My zoom was updating and logged out and when I rejoin it shows unvalid id
cnyambr: his personal one is under Jim's email signature
jnnsmpth: sorry didn't get e1
sarahalamdari: wow
jnnsmpth: You hung up v fast
sarahalamdari: :joy:
coco: 
topology feature can also be leaned with CNN
prelj: I uploaded my slides from yesterday's group meeting to the PRG Drive, under Resources :+1: DM me with questions or corrections
pfaendtner: or DM him with Baby Yoda memes :drooling_face:
ldgibson:  you should've gotten an email from the RCC listserv (or from Jim's forwarding) talking about some computational chemistry lectures/tutorials. It seems like there's a fair amount of people in the group who could benefit from this since everyone seems to be working on building/modifying force-fields, which requires a lot of QM analysis. It's supposed to be a high level overview on how to use the tools mentioned in the email without getting too deep into the weeds, which could help if you are using or will be using those tools for your research.
pfaendtner:  Xiaosong has also asked if we want to join him in doing some of these tutorials - it is good publicity for the group and a good educational opportunity esp. if you are interested in being faculty (you can use stuff like this in your future job applications and grant proposals).  Please email xiaosong directly and cc me if you want to help and he will schedule it
pfaendtner: you can also do it in not just alone but w/1-2 other people.  For each one the group does I will pay you forward a group happy hour later in the summer if you give me a few screen caps from zoom, your slides, and a 1 paragraph write up of what you did and how many attended.  _straight up bribery_ 
xqi: This is a great opportunity! To learn and to give at the same time.
pfaendtner: And to earn beer
nintan2: me likey bribes!
pfaendtner: LEARN AND EARN, XIN
xqi: I’m in!
ldgibson: sign up to teach a lecture, but also sign up to attend and learn the content of the same lecture
pfaendtner: xqi sarahalamdari nintan2 why don't you guys email Xiaosong together and coordiante the ppl who want to help w/the group...

if somenoe could try and get the word out to CSSAS , Laura and the ChemE  students and postdocs  via Allison and Cole that would be great too.  You will look like a rockstar if you are spreading the word and you can take credit for it as your own idea :stuck_out_tongue:
sarahalamdari: Cool! I was just chatting with jnnsmpth about it would be cool to just blast on twitter too if we can :zany_face:
sarahalamdari: And show people how to run MD on their desktops 
pfaendtner: yes on their desktops
pfaendtner: :laughing:
pfaendtner: you can't advertise it on zoom for public consumption though - you will get bombed by racists and assholes
pfaendtner: you CAN record the lectures and post them on youtube
xqi:  Let me do a head count and we’ll send an email together. Respond here if you are interested. :point_down:
sarahalamdari: Hmmm okay! 
pfaendtner: the zoom bombing thing is real and it sounds awful
pfaendtner: well we know it is real from that guy's insta :laughing:
xqi: You mean that Zoom is forbidden in some institutes?
nintan2: people will randomly join your zoom
xqi: haha I see
pfaendtner: no if the zoom link is open and then it gets posted in public people will join and cause a rucus
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: for example
dacb: Pro-tip: use the webinar feature of Zoom and you can avoid Zoom bombers for public sessions.
pfaendtner:  Xin and Nadia will be working with some of you heavy users to clear up disk storage on ikt and mox.  reminder that ikt is going away soon in case you didn't know :laughing:.  The top 3-4 users with the most disk space will need to significantly reduce usage
xqi: what if some heavy users already left :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
pfaendtner: should we just delete their files
sarahalamdari: wait
sarahalamdari: dont be rash
nintan2: i like this game that jim proposes:point_up_2:
sarahalamdari: I need like 1 plumed code chris compiled for 2 more months :joy: I dont want to recompile matheval
sarahalamdari: pls dont make me
nintan2: start flexing my fingers for rm -rf * like crazy :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
sarahalamdari: everything else can go :joy: i promise
xqi: We are able to go inside their directories and delete things other than executables
xqi: does “left for PNNL” count as “left the group”? cuz… ldgibson you are my next target :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
nintan2: xqi do we need to? should'nt doing the deleting from gscratch/pfaendtner is more fun?
jnnsmpth: xqi nintan2 I can tar my files, and archive most of them on Lolo
jnnsmpth: I don't think I'm a top user though so I don't know how useful that would be
xqi:  nintan2 and I have started our mission of “deleting your files” :zany_face: We will start with people who are not here anymore. But if you are using his/her executables, let us know by starting a thread here :point_down: we will keep those.
We will also work with individuals that currently use the highest quota. We will do this through DM.
ldgibson: whoa whoa whoa, i'm still in the group
ldgibson: unless there's something Jim hasn't told me
jnnsmpth: Thanks xqi and nintan2!
pfaendtner:  group coffee hour tmrw at 9 am to welcome stephanie.hare on her 1st day! (attendance is optional)

Along with the slides from today in the same folder! Thanks for the input everyone. :slightly_smiling_face:
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: Guys I am becoming increasingly worried about grads and postdocs in labs who are really isolated either because of small lab or PI that can't/isn't engaged.

Wondering if PRG wants to help me do a community activity for grads/postdocs/faculty in the ChemE department? I was thinking you guys could help me host a trivia night - or something else? Something that scaled pretty well?

I hate to ask you to do more work. But... most of us are doing very well and we have an awesome support network with each other. You guys are surviving this well. I think if there are few ppl who have capacity to stretch and give back and help me with this it would mean a lot to the dept.

[FYI, one of the hallmarks of leadership is just showing up and GSD (_gettin' shit done_). I'm not saying that to guilt you. Do not volunteer for this unless you have capacity and want to. I'm just noting it so you guys can hopefully learn a bit from me about leadership _technique_ as you develop your own _style_].

Think about it and if it makes sense to you before jumping in to volunteer.  :heart: all of you
coco: We can do a ChemE Zoom karaoke :microphone: 
jnnsmpth: Hey PRG, let me know if you're into the idea of a virtual office - we'll be on Zoom at the same time, and each of us will work independently, but if there's a need to discuss something (work or otherwise) people can use breakout rooms. The idea is to mimic an office environment. People are free to come and go as they please, there's no fixed duration, and it's not a meeting. Having two monitors will be ideal, but using a laptop may not be too bad.
We can do this on Monday (04/20) starting at 9 am. Emoji this if you want to give the virtual office a shot!
pfaendtner: This is a great idea, thank you Janani!
pfaendtner: I was just on a call w/the  someone from  UW School of Medicine where - tons of good news coming in about C19 in WA state and even nationwide.

jnnsmpth: <missing_message>
jnnsmpth: Thank you for the reminder Sab!
jnnsmpth: The virtual office is on!
pfaendtner:  check out prg google drive / admin for the proposed sub groups
pfaendtner: here is the concept:

• most or all of you should be in two sub groups 
• they will meet every 2 weeks, so there will be 1 meeting/week for you on average 
• I expect the time to be 60-90 minutes , format TBD 
• X1 is my initial assignment of your primary sub group - this is where you will present results 
• X2 is my initial assignment of secondary - you can help support the research in this sub group 
• Feel free to attend others X3 as a leaner 
• Let me know asap if you want changes in your X1 / X2. If I didn't assing you an X2 you can pick one or just do 1 for now.  
• UG will be handled on a case-by-case basis 
• The idea is to have more frequent interactions, get into the weeds more on research problems , etc.. 
• We will try it for 6 weeks and then re-evaluate ,group meeting is on hiatius during this time. Last GM is next week. 
• Sub groups can start next week or week after. I would love it if 1-2 "X1" from each group would self-organize a bit, talk to each other and then contact me to begin scheduling 

pfaendtner: Let me know asap as possible if there are issues
pfaendtner: thanks
prelj: I think it looks good. I notice you specify that our X1 subgroup is where we will present. Hopefully that is not too restrictive? For some of us X1 and X2 are rather independent and could both benefit from discussion. I acknowledge, of course, that other people in the subgroup who are in it as X1 have high priority over X2s in discussing their own work, but I just want to put it out there.
pfaendtner: ^ agree totally.  depending on the format of how we decide to run each sub-group it might be a little different. I think the SG's will have a little variability on how things go depending on the makeup...
pfaendtner: uhhhh oil prices just went negative
maneki_neko: does this mean they will pay us if we want oil?

xqi: another ad  LOL
cmashraf: here comes 
jnnsmpth: 
Join my virtual office if you want some silent company : )
pfaendtner:  I have been reflecting how much I appreciate having a great library of cookbooks during this pandemic. I'd like to send you all a cookbook in the mail as a very small token of appreciation for how hard you have been working and the great attitude you have shown. Please put your name and address in the Google Doc that is in Administration / Address!  if you want it.

there is a specific general / all purpose book I love that I am thinking of but if you prefer a sub-category put your name in there.

Please do it this afternoon or tmrw AM so I can get it done

prelj: Has anyone else found that their UW proxy to access literature if 404ing?
dacb: Mine looks a little different
prelj: But comedy aside, the technique I have been using to access journal articles is suddenly inoperable.:upside_down_face: Any URL I enter into the proxy, even to non-restricted sites, returns the same 404

jnnsmpth: Kristin was awesome!
jnnsmpth: Thanks for sharing pfaendtner
nintan2: Yes! Thank you Jim!

pfaendtner: she is a PI on my AI Institute grant :pray::skin-tone-4::pray::skin-tone-4::pray::skin-tone-4::pray::skin-tone-4:
pfaendtner:  there is going to be a virtual summer REU run by the clean energy institute. They are desperate for mentors for the virtual REU students and computational oriented projects. This would be a big service commitment to help someone remotely but if you are interested in doing it DM me.  There might be a way for 2 of you to tag team and involve 2 students in a similar project, idk..

_I know you were not enthusiastic about the virtual REU option but it seems to have become our only choice to do something with these students this year._
_The <https://www.cei.washington.edu/training/cebr/|Clean Energy Bridge to Research> summer REU program is an NSF funded REU site whose PI is Christine Luscombe. In March we made offers to 13 outstanding students and had hoped that they could come to UW this summer for hands-on research. Now the COVID emergency and lab limitations have forced us to reformulate our program to a virtual format._ 
_We are urgently seeking labs that conduct primarily computational research and who could mentor these students on a project they could do remotely during summer quarter. The students are majors in Chemistry, Physics, ChemE, EE and ME. We are striving to make this an authentic, quality research experience. The REU students will receive a stipend. They will be supported with a online research seminar series, journal club, and are expected to complete a research project and produce an abstract and poster by the end of summer. The mentors will provide a research project, help them load or access the required software and communicate with these students on a regular basis as their project progresses. Given the virtual format it may work well to have several students work on parallel projects with a single mentor._
nintan2: pfaendtner What REU stands for? i found myself to ask this kind of questions a lot since joining...
pfaendtner: Research Experience for Undergrads - it is primarily a way that NSF funds students to do summer research
nintan2: i see
nintan2: thanks!
maneki_neko: Woah. If they make this work, that's going to really incredible. I hope they'll be able to be successful! I did this REU and they had classes alongside the research too.
sarahalamdari: do I have to be let into seminar? Im confused :]
davidcj: im still waiting to be let in too
coco: custodian was my childhood nightmare ….
pfaendtner: she is a beast
pfaendtner: cookbooks away :slightly_smiling_face:! shipping time slowed way down because amazon is prioritizing essential items. I think you all are getting something different and all are Jill approved :wink:
pfaendtner:  6pm happy hour today! we will play some games if you want to join. I can run 8 ppl at a time on Drawful and Jackbox games so we can rotate in and out - the games only take like 15 mins to play.
coco: Avogadro does not work for me anymore :cry:  I reinstalled and still can not read my file. Any other software that can easily edit atom model?
sl234: sl234 has joined the channel

pfaendtner: normal zoom 2066168128
jnnsmpth: My internet's been unpredictable today. Have fun guys!
pfaendtner: prelj  if you tell me u dont love this one u lying
pfaendtner: Aiche abstracts due on the 30th, y’all 
xqi: Hi  !
We are going to go ahead and cancel GM this week and start subgroup meeting right away. I’m awaiting info for details of all 4 subgroup meetings such that I will be able to put them on Google Calendar. Stay tuned!
pfaendtner:  by COB tomorrow (Thursday 5pm PST) , I would like you to update your work plan document in the google drive. I've added additional info to the skeleton , but also put the requested information below.  Do not revise the content that you previously wrote in terms of your goals and planned deliverables. Just keep adding to the document. Slack me when you have completed it and I will look @ your Google doc.  I apologize for being a week late on this - I really thought we were @ the 2 week mark since the last update (it has been 3 weeks).

*REFLECTION:  4/30* 
*Please continue your document and add commentary in your deliverables in the space below. Were you successful, if not, why do you think this was? (were you too ambitious? Unable to work? Working on something else?)* 

*Do you see any trends from the last month working from home? How do you think things are going?*  

*Are there any near-term things you need help with (research)?* 

*Are there any near-term things you need help with (if not research-related feel free to also slack or email me this)?* 

*What is one good thing that happened in the last two weeks (need not be research or work related, but could be?)*
xqi: All subgroup meeting information has been updated on Google Calendar.
chris.mundy: How do I get to that?
pfaendtner: chris.mundy what is your google account? xqi can add you
chris.mundy: .
chris.mundy: Am I fired again?
pfaendtner: :man-shrugging::skin-tone-4:
pfaendtner: send me some $$$ and we can see if we can forestall it
chris.mundy: Will do
xqi: You are added to the calendar!
jnnsmpth: General Q - while reviewing an atomistic MD paper, I noticed that the authors used Berendsen thermostat/barostat for production runs. Would this make the conclusions in the paper void?
From my understanding, using Berendsen baro/thermostat is a no-no (reposting something Ru posted when I joined the group in 2018):
pfaendtner: it would not make the conclusions void
pfaendtner: if there is a big solvent bath it probably won't matter
pfaendtner: Berenson gets the averages right but the fluctuations are not correct, I think
xqi: Right, it wouldn’t be trustful if they are measuring properties derived from fluctuation
cmashraf: I am not sure, but I think I should just ask - is it okay if I go over the `pandemic research plan` documents of other group members? I feel it will give me an idea about how productive people usually are in this situation and how they are coping with anxiety and stress.
pfaendtner: anything in the PRG drive should be considered open fro the group to read , IMO
pfaendtner: I offered @ the beginning and want to remind everyone that it is fine if you want to take your research plan docs out of the drive and have them just shared w/me
pfaendtner:  also just wanted to observe that I am seeing very high levels of stress / anxiety from all types of ppl on campus - students, staff and faculty. We have a great group but we aren't exempt from these very understandable struggles. I'm here to be a resource for you if you need it and importantly to direct you toward any professional resources you might need to make use of. Unfortunately, we are going to be continuing in this mode, IMO, at least through May. So if that is daunting do not hesitate to ping me and we can figure out a plan together.

In terms of "group care" (happy hours, social times and things), I've fallen off a lot in the last few weeks and it will be a few more weeks before I have bandwidth to lead on that. If someone wants to jump in and help figure out what would be good in terms of social connection ( :cocktail: hour, :coffee: hour, :game_die: time , etc... ) I am very happy to join!

Keep after it, focus on taking care of yourselves, and things are going to be OK
chris.mundy: :+1:
xqi: I like the :game_die: time last time!
sabiha3:  on that topic, I found out this Tuesday that lifewise insurance we have have waived copay for therapy during this period of time. If you are interested in resources I can also help you out. 
sarahalamdari: Quick game night tonight any1?
dacb: I saw you all played Drawful.  "Keep talking and no one explodes" also has a mode like that which is really fun.
sarahalamdari: for anyone interested in game night 
sarahalamdari:  :disappointed:
sarahalamdari: cards against humanity is literally not fun with 3 people :joy: so if anyone wants to join WE’D APPRECIATE THAT
pfaendtner: Lol! I wish I knew!!
pfaendtner: Being a little creative today. Any guesses who I decided to draw? 
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: Probably would be good to buy this and upgrade our amber situation. Anyone know which version we are currently using ?
chris.mundy: I am using Amber_old_new_old2_new_verynew2_old4
chris.mundy: I am pretty sure that is stable.
stephanie.hare: : There is now a template to use for your subgroup research updates in the PRG Google Drive &gt; Subgroups &gt; interfacial_reactions_device_modeling &gt; Quick updates, where you'll find an "empty" template followed by an example of what to include in your updates (using an outdated meme). If you notice any issues with it, formatting or otherwise, feel free to make adjustments and/or let me know!

xqi: SARAHHHH!!! :tada::confetti_ball::heart_eyes_cat::100:
pfaendtner: Awesome!! congrats, Sarah!!
pfaendtner: I am going to give chemistry seminar Thur 3:30-4:30. subject is protein/surface stuff - wondering if someone from the group is going to attend and would you help w/alternate host duties
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: Omgomgomgomgomgomg this is the best 
pfaendtner: chris.mundy ldgibson nintan2 stephanie.hare 
stephanie.hare: Is that really real? No way could that patent actually be granted... right?
pfaendtner: :laughing: I hope not
pfaendtner: this is like one of the most google things that has ever been googled tho
pfaendtner:  I thought I had mentioned this but don't see where. Please review the data management standards doc in PRG drive / administrative . Thumbs up on this msg once you have read it. Let me know if there are questions or concerns.
prelj: "Guidelines for file archive and backup" presumably?
pfaendtner: so good at making graphs
prelj: LMAO in what context was this even made? :joy: (I hate that it's still almost legible)
pfaendtner: I use this all the term
pfaendtner: *time
pfaendtner: it is called dumb terminal in x11
pfaendtner: 'set term dumb'
pfaendtner: you can do dots and lines too
prelj: I love it
maneki_neko: When you need to make a copypasta, but all you have is terminal.
pfaendtner:  I'm doing some peptide folding thermodynamic simulations with MetaD , tuning CVs for trp cage folding.  Plots here show the impact of small changes in the coordination number CV vs the ability to discriminate between relevant states. This is super important to understand when you are selecting CVs for your MetaD simulations.

I don't think I say it enough but:  *the parameters in the PLUMED manual should not be used w/o extensive testing. they are there to show you how to use the CVs they cannot be considered viable parameters for your MetaD simulations until you know more* 
pfaendtner: I've just spent 2 hrs playing with CV parameters , re-running driver over and over on trajectories that I *know* show the desired behavior I want to see in my MetaD simulation
pfaendtner: if you aren't doing this and you are running expensive MetaD calculations: stop now and make sure to reach out to get help.
pfaendtner: The difference between the left and middle plots in these slides can be the difference between blowing 1M CPU hours and getting a good calculation
pfaendtner: BTW: 1M CPU hours is around $5000 in real research money for the group (that I spend) and another $10K that UW spends.
chris.mundy: I couldn’t agree more.  Coordination number is tricky.  I have seen the same. We have about 6 papers out there using these Coordination number.  We umbrella sample it, but that should not be the issue.  We found in that the force constants had to be managed around the cusps.  We also did backward and forward.  This is good to know that I am not stupid.
chris.mundy: Here are some “bench marks” for lack of better wording.  Tell me if you can reproduce these with Meta.  That would be interesting.
chris.mundy: <missing_message>
chris.mundy: I think coordination number space is a great solvent coordinate.  I have not used PBmeta for this.  I would like to learn
chris.mundy: Right, I will stop.  Nobody needs more work.
coco: Anyone has used gmx rdf to calculate water distribution around a peptide?
cnyambr: I use gmx rdf for my polymer/solvent sims analysis
jnnsmpth: Heather Kulik's seminar tomorrow @ 7:00 am pst (only for the brave) - 
pfaendtner: not in my class
coco: I have a question. How much space do we have (per person) on mox . I am trying to decide to move my stuff on ikt to mox or lolo
cnyambr: not alot last time I tried
cnyambr: I tried to setup a virtual environment on mox and it kept saying I'm running out of allocated space.
cnyambr: I think we have to pay for extra storage. Do you know more about this sarahalamdari?
sarahalamdari: I think we doubled it should have 20 TB ish if I remember. You can check in the pfaendtner/ dir for a file called usage_report.txt that tells us how we’re doing on scratch storage  (this applies to whatever partition) 
cmashraf: cnyambr home directory quota is 10GB for each user though. If your anaconda is installed in your home directory, then it is possible to run out of space.
xqi: This is just a quick reminder that we’ve delayed reaction engineering subgroup meeting for a week. Their next meeting will be on 5/20, and the recurrence will still be two weeks based on this date. Thanks!
prelj:  Off in <#C011XKFT2L9|cmtutorials> we have been talking about hosting a zoom session gromacs tutorial for experimentalists in chemistry and related disciplines. The hard work has already been put in, and it's happening, but right now we need *two more PRG member's help* with TAing/administering the tutorial to a small group of ~10-15 via zoom. Time commitment is *Tuesday May 19, 2-4PM* (probably ending early). The tutorial itself is very easy and any PRG member who has done even vanilla MD is competent. I can get you up to speed in no time.
Current PRGs involved are prelj jnnsmpth xqi and sarahalamdari. I need to let the people who put this together know whether we'll be able to have six tutorial groups as intended, but we are still one/two TAs shy from doing that! Please let me know ASAP
prelj: I have found two other MD veterans who are willing to pitch in :slightly_smiling_face: We have the full team of six now and we'll continue the conversation in . Thanks for your attention all!
coco: anyone has tried `conda update` on hyak?
pfaendtner: lol someone just sent me thi
pfaendtner: Have a nice weekend everyone 
pfaendtner:  congrats to nintan2 who successfully got 5 million "NERSC" hours for the group on DOE NERSC.  ldgibson sabiha3 stephanie.hare jnnsmpth orion.dollar ktorke sarahalamdari xqi --&gt; you are all working on DOE projects and can use these hours. Others can too if your projects are relevant , just let us know.

Note that these hours need to be used by middle January.

nintan2 can you please setup a tutorial and show people how to sign up and use it and help track usage, etc.

these should be for _production_ runs with Hyak and your desktops used for prototyping
jnnsmpth: Congrats Nadia!!
dacb: Congrats!
nintan2: :dancingbanana:
nintan2: pfaendtner sure thing! I'll put the tutorial up on PRG googledrive once I figure it out :grin:
pfaendtner: OK cool - might be good to do a group meeting too so we can go over it / Q&amp;A , etc...
pfaendtner: our group has not had to use national supercomputer resources in like 5+ years , so it is new for everyone unless you are a postdoc and used it there
nintan2: Yes Sir
chris.mundy: I know how.  Don’t sweat it.  Use me as a resource.
chris.mundy: I am metaphorically Rick Wakeman when it comes to computers
chris.mundy: Yes, the keyboards are computers.  No, I don’t wear a cape in this metaphor
chris.mundy: Let me know how to help
nintan2: Thanks for the offer chris.mundy
dacb: I don't have as many keyboards, but I do wear a cape. I used to be on the user group exec committee for NERSC. You might want to apply for that role when the open call comes out. We can all nominate you., nintan2.
nintan2: Open call to wear a cape? :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
pfaendtner: hey guys there is rampant fraud in the WA state system for unemployment. Both me and Jill had our SSN stolen and false unemployment claims filed
pfaendtner: You will get a letter in the mail notifying you if someone files a claim but you can also check if someone has already used your SSN by following these steps :
pfaendtner: To check if your SSN has been used to create an account (you won't be able to tell if a claim was filed) , you need to go to the WA employment security website, create an account and do the 'identity verification' step.

1) Go to 
2) Create an account w/your name and email
3) Verify the account
4) Login and take the steps to file a new claim and click the button that says "verify identity"
5) If your SSN has been used you cannot get past the 1st page. See the screencap of what it looks like for me.

6) If you can get past the 1st page just stop and don't keep filing (unless you want some sweet $$$)

7) If someone used your SSN , report it at this website: <https://fortress.wa.gov/esd/file/SecureUpload/unemploymentfraud/report> (edited)
pfaendtner: 8 ) this is what it looks like
sarahalamdari: oh wow :flushed:

sarahalamdari: its been crashing for me all AM
nisargj: yeah I’m trying to log in but it just keeps crashing

```source /gscratch/pfaendtner/jpfaendt/codes/plumed2/sourceme.sh
source /gscratch/pfaendtner/jpfaendt/codes/gmx2020/bin/GMXRC```
jnnsmpth: Is there something more recent that's been compiled somewhere?
pfaendtner: whats the date on those?
pfaendtner: I think that is correct
pfaendtner: yeah , May 7 - still fresh out the oven
pfaendtner: module load icc_19-impi_2019 cmake/3.11.2 gcc/8.2.1 

source /gscratch/pfaendtner/jpfaendt/codes/plumed2/sourceme.sh
source /gscratch/pfaendtner/jpfaendt/codes/gmx2020/bin/GMXRC
pfaendtner: that is the module package
jnnsmpth: Yes, compiled in May, plumed 2.7 and gromacs-2020
jnnsmpth: Thanks, just wanted to be sure. I've been using gmx 2018 so far, but i'll switch since ikt is dead
pfaendtner: everyone gotta pour one out for ikt on monday
jnnsmpth: I second that.
coco: just checking. Has anyone taken care of the legacy codes from previous prgs?
coco: I still source some of arushi’s file such as pf
coco: I am not sure if all of them are copied to mox
sarahalamdari: PF needs to be recompiled on mox
coco: we have pf on mox
pfaendtner: ^^ this is very important to address 
coco: and  I am having “You are over the CPU quota. Kill CPU intensive processes and wait” trying to scp to lolo :cry:
jnnsmpth: My largest directory was 1.5 TB in size, and it took 6 hrs to get transferred. Try breaking your directories into smaller chunks?
cmashraf: get an interactive node
coco: can’t do that with scp I suppose
jnnsmpth: Can you scp on an interactive node?
coco: but I haven’t tried sftp
cmashraf: oh you need internet, right?
sarahalamdari: you can tar on interactive, get off then scp without getting a CPU quota error
sarahalamdari: or do it all on a build node
cmashraf: may be build node then
coco: oh right thx!
coco: Build node works. now it’s much faster! thx
chris.mundy: What about my directories/login.  I have a lot of novel science all in Rosetta Units!  The first sentence is legit.  The second you can safely disregard
chris.mundy: I will need access to facilitate data transfers with my collaborators

pfaendtner: everyone in seattle stay safe. Call me at  if for any reason you need help
sarahalamdari: Hey all, I want to start a conversation about the protests going on right now and the murder of Breona Taylor, Ahmaud Aubrey, George Floyd and so many others before them. All of us are in such a position of privilege and will never experience oppression in the way Black Americans have for so many generations. I’m going to share a few books that I’ve decided to start reading, to begin to dissect my privilege and make positive change even in my small community of people, I hope you all join me in reading these (or suggest more) if you haven’t already. As educators and academics I think we have a responsibility to use our voices to educate others and as people of privilege we can generally do so without consequences. I know you are all really incredible and supportive people and so I hope you choose to use your voice loudly right now

<https://tatianamac.com/posts/save-the-tears>
pfaendtner: Thank you so much for this, Sarah. I have a similar sentiment to what you and stephanie shared in terms of feeling like I don't know what to do. I have been investing more time getting a plan together so I can volunteer to help w/the election and still do my job. Political change is important but there is also a call to action here to do more than volunteer or spend $ to help a politician - I want to learn more.
pfaendtner: I'm very supportive if you have any thoughts or ideas about how the I and the any from the group who are interested can help
sarahalamdari: Thanks Jim for speaking up, it means a lot 
sarahalamdari: Here’s a few other things you can do right now:
1)  Sign petitions 
2) Donate to local bail funds (If you can) to support protestors who are arrested while protesting and unable to post bail - <https://www.nwcombailfund.org/>
3) Text JUSTICE to 668366, Text FLOYD to 55156, Text ENOUGH to 55156

Appreciate you guys for listening and happy to chat in private if you want to DM me
xqi: Thanks, sarahalamdari this is so meaningful! My entire Constitutional Law class was on equal rights, and for a person who just started to learn about history and law, it inspired me to think deeply about the current construction of society. I have a very good friend who works for a high school in MA. We had multiple conversations regarding affirmative action and allocation of resources. She inspired me to think more about outreach and make an change, even to the slightest level of reformation. I’m glad to I’m next to the people who think alike. I’m down to join to help/make an impact. :muscle:
pfaendtner:  Hi group, 

I was reflecting this morning that many of you are feeling confused and deeply disturbed by a lot of the images and video clips that you are seeing surrounding the protests from this weekend and other news from around the world. Some of you might need to step back from your academic work and/or your research, and I wanted to let you know that is OK. You should feel free to let me know you are unplugging for a few days and to take care of yourself first. Your research is important, but it can wait. Others of you might want to dive in even more and find something to focus on other than everything that is going on in the world; that is also OK. There is no one right way to respond to what is happening, and you are each free to figure out your own way to move forward. 

You have my support and please know that I am available to help you navigate through UW resources should you find need for any of them, just reach out and ask. 

Jim
cnyambr: Thanks, sarahalamdari for starting the convo! Thanks, pfaendtner for being so supportive!
sabiha3: Thanks everyone! I was feeling overwhelmed with this and now I don’t feel alone. One more quick resource to also quickly pickup why it happened and how we evolved to here, I recommend the documentary 13th. It’s really shocking 
pfaendtner:  it occurs to me some of you might want to ask questions you are uncomfortable asking even in front of the group.  Feel free to send them to me and I will pose them to the group here in this channel or we can even find a different mechanism to do so if you don't want to do that.  Just tell me that someone else in the group asked if I can setup an anonymous Q submitter.

I get that you might be struggling to ask uncomfortable things. I lived in a very white suburban neighborhood in west michigan and there were 2 persons of color in my graduating class of 250.  2 months later I was on a MARTA subway car in Atlanta at Georgia Tech and I was the only white person in the subway car of &gt; 100 people.

I'm not trying to make this about me, but just to point out that even moving within the country can often be a big cultural excursion, let alone moving to a new country, let alone living in a city where peaceful protests turned violent over the weekend.

_There is no shame in not understanding._ No question is too big or too small.  Ask away if you are confused and want to learn more. We will share some ideas and thoughts and resources and help you keep learning and learn from you. If someone asks a question or makes a statement that upsets you, be gentle and understanding and know that we will all work on this together like the family we are :slightly_smiling_face:
pfaendtner: hey lets be inclusive.  don't forget dorothy in your emoji festival
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: This was very hard to listen to, but there is a nice dialogue in the middle that discusses the impact of what happens when there is looting and vandalism with protest. It is an incredibly hard subject to get your heard around and understand. I have a lot of thinking to do...
cnyambr: I would also recommend people check out Obama most recent post on Instagram. He laid out a great path forward. 
cnyambr: Last thing: Please watch this video in full. It answers: Why was racism created? When was the word “white” used in reference to a group of people in laws, what was life like before racism was in full effect? 
coco: Protest will happen in university village and Bellevue today. Stay home.
sarahalamdari: Or if your protesting, do so safely and make sure to write someones phone number you can call on your arm :slightly_smiling_face:
sarahalamdari: Not that you need another reason to order Ezzells :zany_face: 
orion.dollar: lol i’ve prob ordered enough to singlehandedly keep the CD ezells afloat over here

pfaendtner: They interviewed a leader from this group on Pod Save America yesterday. He went through based on evidence, what works and what does not work to limit the use of police force in unnecessary situations.  It is a great interview and an awesome resource to support and think about ways that we can work to make a difference.
pfaendtner: I am going to donate regularly to this org, follow them on social media and try and educate family and friends in my FB feed. There is a nice table on the website that shows what cities in your states are doing in terms of meeting the evidence based criteria to have a police department that will reduce use of violence against black men.
nintan2:  If you wish to use our NERSC allocation, I have put a step by step how to in googledrive/resources. If you have any question, feel free to ask me. I am also open to a meeting session to walk people through and Q&amp;A
pfaendtner:  social hour at 4pm tomorrow and then some games (ktorke which jackbox games do you want to play?!) 
ktorke: jackbox games require you to either have drawing skills or be funny... since I don't fit either of those criteria, its best if I watch :sweat_smile:
pfaendtner: there is the trivia one! :laughing:
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: unbelievable
pfaendtner: It is an old article but somehow i think Angewante reposted it in their RSS Feed or something, appears to be fixed now
pfaendtner: ppl are getting a bit confused thinking it is a new article
sarahalamdari: :joy::sob: “candidates inclusion in one of the preferred social groups may override his or her qualifications” 
stephanie.hare: If you’ve watched 13th, this strikes me as a direct consequence of the “black fear” that was instilled in people in the 80s. It’s like, people are so fearful of changing the current racial hierarchy that they come up with completely nutty reasons to not do so, like this
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: oh I was wrong. This shit article is brand new
pfaendtner: I think angewante took it down
pfaendtner: but they are still responsible for accepting it
stephanie.hare: whaaaAAAAATTT
pfaendtner: off our group's list for future consideration for submission or review until their editors address how this happened
pfaendtner: that fucking graphic shows "diversity of workforce" as a "negative influence" on organic chemistry.  what the fucking fuck
pfaendtner: The reason I am so angry about this is that I had the apparently false impression that the editorial board of a premier academic journal might have the common sense to not publish this without additional comment and especially in a moment like this.

I want to be clear that I really believe in free speech and bigoted professors should have the chance to burn down their own careers publicly. But this is so far beyond the pale at all, let alone for what many consider a top 3 chemistry journal.

It doesn't mean I'm any less angry about everything else that is going on. I think it is just the shock at seeing it this close to home.
stephanie.hare: Agreed. I am honestly speechless
pfaendtner: if you are speechless just drop &gt;3x f-bombs in one sentence. it feels great
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: oh ok it is all fine now
stephanie.hare: I am so confused
pfaendtner: they are getting pillored over their terrible response to their terrible decision
stephanie.hare: That graphic makes no sense. Integrity of the literature is a negative influence...?
pfaendtner: the social media team is trying a Trump move by saying "it wasn't the final version" :laughing::laughing:
sarahalamdari: The whole paper makes no sense :joy: I don’t care if it’s an opinion piece scientists use data and research and studies to form opinions, this has no place in literature

_Feel free to share._

_In response to recent events that have laid bare the institutional racism and acts of state violence that continue to occur towards the Black community in our country, the UW Chemistry Diversity Committee will hold a "Lunch and Learn" via Zoom this *Friday, June 5* *from* *11:30-1:00*. The purpose of this meeting is to recognize these issues as a community, to listen to one another, and to brainstorm ways that we as individuals and as a Department can respond._

_We would love to see you there ()._

pfaendtner:  can you check if your PhD GSR is a chemistry professor?

coco you have Drobny , or someone else?

Anyone else?
sarahalamdari: I have Brandi
coco: I have xiaosong as gsr 
lemmoi: I just wanted to share, Brandi was one of my chemistry professors for honors gen chem freshman year and she really had an influence on my perceptions about who you can be in academia, and I know even more so for my female friends in that class. She's a rockstar in her field and a huge inspiration for anyone who doesn't fit the standard professor stereotype. I'm really grateful to have the experience of learning under her
coco: I need to find someone who is not chem cheme or mse:thinking_face:
ldgibson: I’m pretty sure professors from the Psychology dept are fine

orion.dollar:  hey just wanted to let everyone in the group know there’s an all-member union meeting this Thursday at 5 pm. a large part of the agenda will be discussing UAWs role in promoting racial justice within the Seattle labor council and the ways individual members can help out. there should be a zoom link emailed out in the next couple days so if you’re interested and a member of UAW keep an eye out for that!
pfaendtner:  In light of the #ShutDownAcademia movement planned for tomorrow and the Black Lives Matter Seattle-King County statewide general strike on Friday, I am canceling our technical subgroup meetings on Wed and Fri.

I support all of you who want to participate in these important activities, and I will be finding my own way to participate. We may have a group-wide activity Wed AM, more soon.

I am available to meet individually with any of you who wish to meet this week. Please schedule directly with me and let me know what days you are available. It is also fine to wait - I understand.
jnnsmpth: Thanks a lot Jim.
Let's put a pin on having a group meeting on Wednesday (tomorrow) morning. There's no agenda as of now, but having some structure might be useful. Please let me know what you think (DM me) and whether there's something in particular that you want to talk about. Remember that we will only have 1-1.5 hrs, so we need to find a way to follow up on our action points.
We want chris.mundy and dacb to join us as well!
xqi: Thanks for the great ideas Janani and Jim! I’m down for joining! 
thinking about what I can share now
sarahalamdari: I’ll reshare this link here -&gt;  there a lot of resources compiled here if you’re not sure where to start
jnnsmpth:  Group meeting at 10 am tomorrow. We will not have subgroup meetings this week. Please plan to be there. I will share the agenda shortly. <https://washington.zoom.us/j/7497012826>
jnnsmpth: <missing_message>
jnnsmpth: I've put together this agenda for tomorrow which is in no way perfect or exhaustive, but it gives us a place to start. Thanks Sarah, Orion, and Xin for your comments and feedback.
pfaendtner:  just want to be totally clear that this is an optional meeting.  All are welcome. You can come just to listen if you want. And you might have something to share. 

Totally fine if you want to pass as well.  Everyone has their own process. Reach out if you are in need of help or advice.  
nintan2:  <http://chemlabs.princeton.edu/csi2020/> this looks very cool! If you are interested, register asap, as I dont know if this is a first come first serve thing however, they only accept 50 participants. Although the 9 AM EST starting time is a bummer
pfaendtner:  for our meeting at 10 am, if you are joining
pfaendtner: Thanks everyone for your time, ears and voices.  The doc I mentioned is here: 

More soon
pfaendtner:  just saw this on Twitter and I think it is stellar. I will download it to the Google Drive.

One of the things I noticed in there did not come up in our conversation. It is learning about the history of racist anti-Black acts in science. I earlier this year I listened to an informative podcast on the Tuskegee experiment. I highly recommend it if you do not know about this history. It is also important because it immediately prefaced a lot our laws about informed consent by humans in research studies and institutional oversight through IRB (<https://podcasts.apple.com/dz/podcast/tuskegee-syphilis-study-first-do-no-harm-1/id1435516849?i=1000441126078>)

pfaendtner: Did you guys see that ACS meeting in August is going to be 100% virtual? prelj stephanie.hare jnnsmpth chris.mundy @DonaldTrump
pfaendtner: ^^ oops he's not in this slack team , but I need to tell him about his poster on computational lobster
stephanie.hare: I did see that! Gonna be weird as hell
pfaendtner: you guys ready to come back to B17 - I ordered PPE
jnnsmpth: For anyone interested in joining my virtual office this AM 
chris.mundy: @UWPRG are there any issues that I need to be aware of when using metadynamics with NpT?
pfaendtner: Yes.l
pfaendtner: Technically the virial should be corrected with the additional metad forces. 

There are some examples of this happening in solid state systems.

In general we just do nvt to. It have to worry about this. 

In a system with explicit solvent and biasing just a few solute dof it should be a fine approximation. 

What type of system ?
pfaendtner: . ktorke and I were discussing a new MetaD project , to get ready for some simulations of estimating thermodynamics of helix formation in different types of peptide/peptoid systems.  A Q came up, which is 'which variant of MetaD should I use?'  --&gt; This is a great Q and I just wanted to remind everyone of a few basic concepts
pfaendtner: 1. Your MetaD is only as good as your CVs... BUT your biasing scheme (the MetaD variant) can also significantly affect the outcome and success of your simulation.  Therefore, I always find it useful to de-couple the two.  I test CVs using *standard* MetaD so that I can be sure the biasing is not determining whether or not I will be successful.  If you use reasonable standard MetaD parameters (in biomolecular: pace = 1000 , height = .1 kt ), you will have, within 10-20 ns, a reasonable test of whether or not your CVs are going to be sufficient.   You should be able to see multiple recrossings between your stable basins and you should not be "stuck" in any well  .  If you don't get this done then you need to reconsider your CVs....  
2. Well-tempered is your 1st weapon to improve the convergence of your bias potential. if you have 2 good CVS and you want to converge the bias potential, WTM can be tried. Frequent problems here include 'getting stuck'. Lots of reasons for this I won't get into. But ppl often tack on multi-walkers and/or PT to address this.  
3. Parallel Bias is used when there are many slow d.o.f. or degenerate slow d.o.f. - a canonical example is a situation where you have pep-pep association , with conformational change in each pep relevant , AND ion-sidechain pairing also being relevant.  This cannot be done with classic (standard or WTM MetaD). It could be done w/bias exchange MetaD but we don't really use that. PB can effectively be combined with PT 

pfaendtner: Just a few notes. Most important. Get in the habit of doing #1 - especially when studying new systems. Look at the movies of your trajectories and STUDY how the bias is leading to conformational change.  If you are stuck in CV space, look at the movies and STUDY what is happening and get clues about what additional or different CVs might lead to being 'unstuck'.  There is no substitute for studying your trajectories. I will always ask "what did you see when you looked at the trajectory?"
pfaendtner: Final note: many CVs have adjustable parameters (as in COORD) and all CVs have a sigma value that must be determined.  The numbers for these that are presented in the PLUMED manual should be treated as nonsense. You can _*never*_ just take those numbers from the manual and use them
chris.mundy: This is great.
chris.mundy: What about NpT
pfaendtner: ^^ look at my notes up there from last night?
chris.mundy: Sorry.  Missed that
pfaendtner: • ohhh PLUMED 2.0.0 release notes:  T*he virial contribution is now computed and passed to the MD code. Plumed can thus now be used to perform biased NPT simulations.*

chris.mundy: There we go
chris.mundy: Thank you
pfaendtner: I am still thinking back to 2009 when PLUMED was just a collection of C-codes we passed around the group and not called PLUMED.
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: ^^ did you guys know you can calcualte weights at different T, P ? this is wild
prelj: Oh nice! First I'm learning about the NPT success
pfaendtner: if you are doing a condensed phase system and your CVs just apply to a small subset of your atoms, then the additional forces are going to be negligible.  Think of peptide in water and you are biasing RGYR or something... good to do it properly, but unlikely to matter
pfaendtner: on the other hand if you are doing NPT and applying CVs to the unit cell vectors to achieve phase change, you must include it or your results will be bunk
pfaendtner: BUNK
pfaendtner:  exists
xqi: Hi everyone ! I’m trying to set up an OpenFF tutorial given by their software scientists. The tutorial is expected to be an hour long, but we can extend it to 90 min if necessary. Is Next Wednesday (6/24) at noon okay for people who are interested? Please give a :+1: if this time works fine or a :-1: if it doesn’t work. Thanks!
xqi: Looks like an unanimous agreement — I will set up a zoom link and add it to the group calendar
xqi: It’s up on the calendar!

```Dear ChemE community,

In collaboration with undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc trainees, the Diversity Committee is organizing a series of Chemical Engineering Diversity, Equity, Inclusion (DEI) Town Halls. We invite all our department members to join. 

Our first Town Hall will take place this Thursday, June 18th, 3:30-4:40 via Zoom. To receive the Zoom link please register here() (2 seconds to complete). This Town Hall is a Listening Town Hall.  We will gather stories of racism, oppression, and discrimination in STEM that have already been shared publicly - #BlackinIvory is a good starting point - and together read the shared stories out loud. Readers will acknowledge and attribute the voice of the storyteller where available. The goal is to listen and to internalize. We encourage you to join and listen even if you are not a reader or story sharer. 

The purpose of this story sharing is to remove the burden on any one individual of sharing personal experiences, which can create mental and emotional vulnerability, and can disproportionately affect those in our community who are most marginalized, underrepresented, or oppressed.  Anyone attending the event who feels comfortable doing so can also share a personal story during the event. Our community guidelines in response to individuals sharing personal stories during the event are as follows: (1) we thank the individual for sharing, and (2) we take a moment to reflect without discussion or questions. These ground rules focus us on the act of listening first, to hearing the individual sharing the story, and to sitting with the experiences and feeling their weight. Stories can be submitted here(<https://forms.gle/9EttJDC7PejxSePHA>) and will be compiled for Thursday. You can also send them to me in email (<mailto:eanance@uw.edu|eanance@uw.edu>), if you prefer.  If you have a personal story to share, please do not feel the need to submit via this form, unless you want, prior to the event.

We will have a second ChemE DEI Town Hall on Thursday June 25th, 3:30-4:30 via Zoom. The purpose of this second town hall will be to identify and discuss actionable ways in which we can make permanent changes in the department that holistically address diversity, equity, and inclusion. More details will follow prior to this second town hall meeting, including a report out of suggestions submitted on the DEI feedback form (anonymously shared <https://forms.gle/cPz3EL6mttwCjdoF6>) and a summary of the past and current initiatives of the Department Diversity Committee.

Please mark your calendars for monthly ChemE DEI Town Halls on the following dates:
July 23, 3:30-4:30
August 27, 3:30-4:30
September 24, time TBD
Details and purpose of each Town Hall will be provided one week prior to each event.

This is ongoing work and I believe we can leverage the momentum and the collective desire to act to create a stronger and more equitable ChemE community, and an empowering space for all our department members. 

I look forward to seeing you Thursday.

Best,
Elizabeth```
sarahalamdari: sorry for ze late notice!
sarahalamdari: heres the townhall zoom link for this afternoon since this is a safe space to share it: 
ldgibson: , just wanted to check if anyone in the group is interested in applying for the outreach coordinator position in RCC. The roles of the outreach coordinator are here in the club constitution:
&gt; Outreach Coordinator
&gt; The outreach coordinator is responsible for spreading knowledge about the existence and efforts of the RC Club and bringing in new users. They will publicize the RC Club to applicable departments across UW as well as in courses that have a focus on RC. The outreach coordinator will organize RC Club social events and coordinate with UW-IT to schedule club tours of Hyak.

pfaendtner: chris.mundy if you take a complex molecule like a dipeptide and do MP2/&lt;&lt;big basis set&gt;&gt; in 2 different electronic structure codes like Gaussian vs QChem  - what is your level of confidence you will get the same energy within a tight boudn like .1 kt
chris.mundy: You should get milli hartree.
chris.mundy: agreement.
chris.mundy: 600 kcal  ---&gt; 1 a.u.
pfaendtner: Wait do you expect it to agree within milihartee. Or did you back calculate .1kt to au? 

I’m just curious about much you expect the results to be reproducible between codes 
chris.mundy: 1 milli hartree.  I was adding the conversion to kcal for the general public.  I was going to see what kind of kcal that is, then I realized that I didn’t care and lost steam.   sorry to be confusing.  So to try to be clear.  Milli Hartree agreement between two codes would make me beleive that things are ok.
chris.mundy: addendum:  And now that it is morning, I had coffe, and that jives with your estimate.  So, we were saying the same thing.

pfaendtner: ^^ this is a nice paper, it explains very clearly why we use Berendsen and then Parrinello Raman barostat and introduces a new barostat that we will use as soon as it is available in the next gmx release
pfaendtner: :heart: Giovanni Bussi
pfaendtner:  - (all grads and postdocs working this summer) if you are in need of any supplies for your home office I'd like to cover up to $400 in approved supplies. I suggest thinking about getting a good pair of noise canceling headphones to help you concentrate and a good chair (both of those will be approved by me w/no further checking - up to $200 each) or if there are other items that is OK too.

Process:
1. All orders through Amazon. Find the items you want. Get my pre-approval if required (i.e., not an office chair and/or noise canceling headphones) 
2. Use the ChemE purchase request tool (<https://www.cheme.washington.edu/mycheme/Purchase_Request.html>) and the staff will order the item and ship it to your home address. Budget number is: <https://ucs.admin.uw.edu/MyFD/UWNetID/BudgetList.aspx#|68-2707> 
3. Send me an email to me and <mailto:cefiscal@uw.edu|cefiscal@uw.edu> and xqi or her delegate _see step 5_ asking me for approval to purchase these items (put links and budget #). I will reply all yes (this is an audit compliance issue). 
4. In your email also clearly state that you understand you will be responsible for returning these items to Benson Hall once normal work resumes.  This is critical that you agree to do this - so please do not order anything if you cannot comply. 
5. Follow the instructions for recording the inventory and location of these purchases. xqi we will need to keep track of everything we buy - can you do this or appoint someone to do it? I suggest making a spreadsheet in PRG drive / administrative and logging it there including date purchased and current location of the item...
Note: if you buy a chair you will probably be responsible for assembling it. Please take some time to read comments, we have had bad luck ordering our own chairs before.  A "task chair" is a good thing to search for since it is ergonomic and designed to be good for office work. If you want to buy anything that deviates from this, you will have to check with me. The pre-approval is task/office chairs only.

Note: you must use this process. No reimbursements of your own purchase and no going over the limits and partially covering it yourself.

Note: use 'threads' to reply with Q&amp;A so we don't clog the general channel and lose this message. I will also pin it.

That is all.  Good luck.
xqi: Hey guys! This is a reminder that we have a guest Open Force Field tutorial today at noon. The tutorial is accessible via:  Hope to see you there!
xqi: There’s a small prep step for the tutorial, I’m copying and pasting the speaker’s (Jeff Wagner) instruction here:
```In preparation for today's talk, could you have any group members interested in doing hands-on work install the OpenFF toolkit? We support Linux and Mac. If folks are already conda users, it should be as simple as:

conda create -n openff -c omnia -c conda-forge openforcefield mdtraj
conda activate openff

If folks are not already conda users, we have more complete install instructions here: 

We just made a major release yesterday, so it'll be good for folks to update, even if they have an existing environment. 

It should be sufficient to just forward this email on to your group members. I can also help debug any install issues after the talk.```

xqi: Here’s a jupyter notebook and some supporting files for today’s tutorial! See you in a bit :blush:
jnnsmpth: Have to teach now, thanks for putting this together xqi!
ldgibson: `rm -r ~/Library/Jupyter/nbextensions/nglview-js-widgets/`
ldgibson: ^ the fix for if your `nglview` doesn’t give an error but also doesn’t show any image
jnnsmpth: Does anyone know how GROMACS unwraps coordinates (like how does it make the molecules whole)?
LAMMPS would store 3 flags which indicate which image of the simulation box (in each dimension) the atom would be in if its coordinates were unwrapped across periodic boundaries. An image flag of 0 means the atom is still inside the box when unwrapped. A value of 2 means add 2 box lengths to get the unwrapped coordinate. A value of -1 means subtract 1 box length to get the unwrapped coordinate. I don't know if GROMACS does this, also not sure how the '-pbc whole' command works. Asking for an analysis script that I'm writing
chris.mundy: Are you looking for a “how”,  to write unwrapped  coordinates, I can help.  If specific to gromacs, likely not.  CP2K never wraps that is the right thing to do always.  You then don’t run into these problems espicially for difussion, etc where jumps by L/2 mess things up.  To wrap a broken trajectory is pretty straightfoward.  I sort on the COM using PBCs and translate.
chris.mundy: Is that what you are looking for?
chris.mundy: Sorry if not.
chris.mundy: I do like the LAMMPS trick.  THat is nice.  You can get that vector by scaling:  h_inv r = s.  Then dnint (s).  This will give you that vector.
chris.mundy: h_inv is the cell matrix (inverse).
chris.mundy: s = matmul (h_inv, r )
chris.mundy: s = s - dnint (s)
chris.mundy: the nint part  is the cell vec.
chris.mundy: I really like that lammps stores that!  Thank you.
chris.mundy: But you can compute it from this simple code.  I don’t know what dnint is in python.  I think Luke knows this.
chris.mundy: I love being distracted:  Send me a frame with cell dimensions, I will write a quick code to unwrap.  Fun.
ldgibson: to decode Chris’s mystical fortran code, `dnint()` could just be replaced by `round()` in python
chris.mundy: Thank you Luke.  Luke speaks all languages in the galaxy.  I am unable to translate Sith.
chris.mundy: Algorithm:
chris.mundy: 1.  h = (a. b, c ) ---&gt; a b c column vectors it will be a familiar 3x3 matrix with L on diagonals
chris.mundy: 2. compute h_inv (use you favorite way for a general code or just hard code it for simple orthorhombic box
chris.mundy: 3. Do i = 1, natoms
chris.mundy: (assuming natoms is your busted  up molecule)
chris.mundy: s = matmul ( h_inv, r )  r is xyz in your real world
chris.mundy: compute round(s)
chris.mundy: This will be the vector Lammps stores.  I believe you then translate by the opposite of that vector?  so r = r - dnint(s)*L  (ok, that was sloppy, but you see where I am going…
chris.mundy: Tell me if it is wrong.  I am known to be wrong often.  :wink:
chris.mundy: Luke.  Make sense?
ldgibson: yeah, that’s what I’ve been doing when I deal with the dipole analysis
chris.mundy: END DO
jnnsmpth: Thanks Chris, super useful! I guess this is what gromacs does in the absence of an ‘image flag’, but yes, things are a lot more straightforward when you know what that vector is. I was wondering if I missed something in my output. Doesn’t seem like it though  
chris.mundy: This is in the Tri City Herald.  Its real.
chris.mundy: We will be in Phase 1 until the sun explodes.
chris.mundy: Did I break Slack etiquette?  It appears that this should have appeared in Random?  We can create a new thread: “Generally Random?”  With question mark.  Peace.
pfaendtner: chris.mundy not at all.  We actually just tend to use general and random interchangeably.  You could have reasonably put this in either one :laughing:
pfaendtner:  I'm wondering if we want a separate space just for computer skills / trips, etc.  Like in the last week we have had conversations about different things like scripting, writing code, etc... would be good to have a place that will archive it ? thoughts? channel name?
pfaendtner:  re-posting Chowdhury's post in <#CCXKR4RRU|journal-club> - everyone in the gruop should read this. <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04150#.XvVVczYQbMs.twitter>

ldgibson: Hey all, we recently adjusted our subgroup meeting format and Jim suggested that we share it with the rest of the group. We had originally been doing a 3-part meeting where 1 person gives a longer research update (30 min), another person did a lit review (30 min), and then everyone did a 1-slide update (30 min). The new plan is a slight adjustment from the old one in which we have 3 people give short updates (roughly 3-5 slides, 10-15 minutes) that contain 3 things:
1. the same slide from the past week that lists your action items to discuss whether or not the goals were met (see bullet 3)
2. slide(s) on your latest work that you want to discuss (things that worked, didn't work, latest plot, etc.) or other topics (paper review, new project discussion, etc.)
3. slide with action items to be completed by the next meeting (will be copied onto the next presentation) + any critical issues preventing work
The 4th person also does this, but is expected to give a longer, more in-depth presentation (20-30 minutes). We're a smaller subgroup (4 X1's) so this works for us pretty well, although, we've only done 1 meeting. Maybe this will help with the other subgroups :man-shrugging:

pfaendtner: Awesome news! Former PRG postdoc Luiz Oliveira just landed a faculty job in chemistry at Mount Vernon Nazarene U! He is so excited to move there with his family
pfaendtner: It is an awesome fit for his career goals and things were getting dicey AF w.r.t. visas and contracts so it is really timely. He is going to be awesome in the role!
pfaendtner:  I've contracted someone who can help us reboot the PRG website and will do a lot of the related work. I need you guys to help in creating images they can use to make the new site.  Orion will be also helping work w/the developer so if you see a request from him you can treat it like it came from me.

Each subgroup needs a few research images from your projects.  These should be things that are mostly custom - try and create very nice VMD visualizations and render them at a high resolution.  Also good practice for presentations and posters and we will retain this for everyone to use.

In your sub groups directory there is a folder called "website images"  with subfolders for each subgroup - deposit files there.

In general we are going to need header images for each of our pages and the landing page for each project. We will also need smaller images (can be more technical) where we have research descriptions. You can make images of all sizes - don't worry about it fitting on a website, he will crop, do new layouts, etc...

There will be other changes - I'm not sure if we will do a blog or news section (not both, just one of them), there will be a DEI section that we will work on together, etc.

Graphics for the website are the most important part to get the new thing up and running.  Please try and do this within a week without reminder from me (everyone should try and contribute something)

*Edit:* <!channel> please emoji respond that you received this and will be responsive.

pfaendtner: Side conversation about MetaD convergence w/some other ppl , ya'll might find this useful?

1. How much is your bias potential still changing? [_we look at this by doing the FE as a function of '% completion' like 70, 80 , 90 , 100. If the bias potential is changing more than several kT in areas of CV space you care about, keep running the simulation_]
2. if 1=yes , then to what extent is your system sampling phase space? [_we don't have a quantifiable metric here but we know boundary conditions: if no sampling at all under the region of 'convergence' in 1 - then there is a problem. If excellent sampling then no problem.  What about 1 walker stuck others sampling? probably OK but we don't know. this is why it is important to at minimum discuss if not show the CV space vs time. If your walkers mostly or all stuck - then you need to revisit CV choice and/or biasing scheme/parameters_]
3. as long as 2 != *all walkers are stuck* , then what are the average value and variance of the key observables for study , and what does the instantaneous value of the observable look like vs time. [_classical example here is delta-F vs T , but other ensemble averages are fine to think about w.r.t. reweighting, etc..._ ]
4. once you have done 3, then you can ask your science question "e.g., how does system A vary from system B?"  [_this is why it is critical to remember you don't need kT error bars - you just need to have confidence that your averages of your observables are sufficiently different to support your science claims.  Remember - kT is the minimum variance in an MD simulation because of thermal flucs. So the minimum irreducible error in your system is : *kT + systematic FF error*_]

pfaendtner: &gt; Dear AIChE Student Chapter Presidents and Chapter Advisors,
&gt; AIChE is now accepting submissions for the Undergraduate Research Forum at the  for student members who are interested in presenting their work. The Undergraduate Research Forum will be held between 2 sessions on Monday, November 16th. The first session will focus on Chemicals, Biotechnology, and the Environmental, and the second session will focus on research related to Energy, Materials, and Petrochemicals.
&gt; *Please let your Student Chapter members know about this opportunity.*
&gt; This is a great chance for students who participated in the Regional Conference Paper Competition, but may not have won first place, to still have a chance to present at the Annual Meeting.
&gt; *Submissions should be sent via <https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLSeQbPL4oVLNiCVeNZjNcosIGPqu2ueDa7H-3DTYCphA-GFs-Q%2Fviewform%3Fvc%3D0%26c%3D0%26w%3D1&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cjindal.shah%40okstate.edu%7C5efd5f34be6c4c63bef508d82ac4fc83%7C2a69c91de8494e34a230cdf8b27e1964%7C0%7C0%7C637306372832122329&amp;sdata=ETl25amL4gY2s%2FHLomfvxBwBFsT%2B9qeILGF%2BN96QQ%2BQ%3D&amp;reserved=0|this submission form> no later than August 10*.

xqi: Hey everyone! I just uploaded an instruction to use GROMACS 2020 (with and without plumed) on NERSC Cori. You can find it both under the PRG shared Google drive/Software and Github/GROMACS. Note that GROMACS 2020 has deleted the -multi flag for mdrun, so special care should be taken if you want to run multiple walkers and/or replica exchange.
pfaendtner:  reminder that I asked all grads and postdocs to contribute website images no later than tomorrow (7/22). UG are welcome to contribute as well. You may take through Thursday 7/24 but I expect everyone to do this.
pfaendtner: PS you can use existing figure images, covers, great images from presentations, etc..  quality needs to be high and they need to be appropriate for web use.  (e.g., do not use a graph w/axis fonts that are 8 point )
stephanie.hare: Did the PRG stack the raffle?
stephanie.hare: Or are we just winners by nature?
jnnsmpth: Can someone share the link to today's townhall?
pfaendtner:  A postdoc in Chemistry has organized an amazing workshop series on racial equity in STEM with a ton of topics you might be interested in.  ChemE and I have sponsored the workshop. My contribution is from the Rogel professorship.

PRG has 1 guaranteed seat at each of the 15 workshops. It can be a different person at each workshop and the rest of the ChemE department has 3 additional seats. We will give up our remaining seats to the department.

You can browse the sessions in the attached PDF and sign up at this link: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lA6_6WcykCWTQqS-qPyu7KRtCKcrfk2P_CWnNG0IT0g/edit?usp=sharing>

tludwig8:  Hey all! Jim and I were just discussing some ideas about next steps for our MIPs project and found it would be useful to launch lots of simulations that have varying mole fraction of species. Does anyone have a recent example of their workflow for something like this (or would like to chat about the topic)? My systems would be built with packmol and ran using GROMACS, but I am sure any advice/examples would be of use. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks!
pfaendtner: hi everyone - are there examples of scripted workflows for this for James to study?
ldgibson: The only one I'm familiar with was Wesley's
pfaendtner:  thank you to those of you who submitted website images. I will follow up with additional folks on an as-needed basis in order to get what I need for the project.
davidcj:  Hey gang. :slightly_smiling_face: I hope you are all well.

You all mean *a lot* to me, and so I wanted to write a note to try and express this. I tried many times from many angles to write this note,  but no version has quite been able to touch all the emotion and passion I really feel towards you all. This is my best attempt. In the end, if you take anything from this, please know that I learned an incredible amount from each of you.

In the most sincere degree, PRG, I thank you for making me a better scientist, and a better person. I know certainly we will see more of each other for years to come - at the pub, at the chalk board, and in scientific collaborations. :heart:
pfaendtner: good luck, Dave!
nintan2:  our REU students cmb67 joshalv wxq910 will be giving lightning talks of their summer works in PRG on Monday Aug10th at 2PM. All PRGs are welcome to join <https://washington.zoom.us/j/91837533989>
pfaendtner:  did you know you can log VMD commands to TCL console? This helps you learn how to automate things in the TCL console - everything in VMD is a TCL command and can be scripted.  You can also execute VMD from the command line and never have to open the GUI when you have a script to run.
prelj: ^ good advice. When making figures for the PRG website I found that my VMD was crashing whenever I asked too much of the render. I had to do it from VMD text mode -- it takes a minute to get used to but has more capabilities than the GUI :+1:
pfaendtner: Please Avoid Plotting Analytical Response against Logarithm of Concentration | Analytical Chemistry
 2020 is getting the punchiest article titles 
prelj: They said please :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
pfaendtner:  nam just told me there are almost 200 GPUs and nobody is using them via ckpt
pfaendtner: you should get your workflows setup for AMBER on this
pfaendtner: GMX too
chris.mundy: What’s a gpu?
chris.mundy: Kidding of course.
pfaendtner: giggle pickle unit
chris.mundy: Yes…  I could use 200 of them!
pfaendtner:  have a great weekend everyone. I miss ya'll!
jnnsmpth: When biasing the water coordination (hydration), are people using the O atom in water, or the whole molecule?
jnnsmpth: Does it matter?
pfaendtner: you just need to think about your r0 value ...
jnnsmpth: I remember Josh saying something about the noise with including H groups, but that was super long ago..
pfaendtner: I would take a short sim of a water box with your water model and calc the COORD w/ a few diff values and see.. doing H-O contacts is more precise , but more fussy with the PLUMED setup. You can always reweight to get that pair distribution function if you want
pfaendtner: H-O is frozen in water, so there shouldn't be any difference in the end as long as you are careful
chris.mundy: That’s right.  You will need to play with r0 and the steepness of the curve.  this is tricky, buy straightfoorwrd.  You wi;; need to test
chris.mundy: Look at our papers with Santanu Roy.   Also the CaCl2 paper with Marcel.  The coordination can look funky.
pfaendtner: thinking about a single i-j pair in the COORD function , you want it at 0.9-1.0 in the eqm distance of whatever pair dist you want, and you want it absolutely decayed to zero by the time the RDF is leveled off at 1 for the same system
pfaendtner: so the idea is that your bias is only being applied in the solvation shells that appear for your given Hamiltonian
pfaendtner: (IMO)
pfaendtner: actually I've never thought about it this way, but this is a convenient way to get your params ? (maybe)
chris.mundy: It is not one size fits all for sure…
chris.mundy: We have done lots of these calculations for small solutes (this will be germain to NaCl).
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: mundy do you agree?
pfaendtner: FYI your coord CV will not range from 0-1 but that doesn't matter
pfaendtner: this concept is just to show you where it should be valued @ 1 and where it should go to 0
chris.mundy: Please look at what we did.
chris.mundy: Maybe it will help
xqi: I just did something like this. Maybe I can help a little? jnnsmpth
chris.mundy: My experience with CN is that is  not as “rare-eventy”
 as distance.  You can get a good handle on this from just a constrained distance-run and then use the function to optimize the CN number, etc.
chris.mundy: Xin did this  for a big protein and it had a single well that ramped up on either side of n0.  For smaller solutes it will look “spikey” like the work  we did with Santanu/Marcel.
chris.mundy: I don’t have a feel for the bigger, non spherical objects…  xqi pfaendtner will have better advice.
xqi: In deed, like this :point_down:
xqi: <missing_message>
jnnsmpth: ^^ wow :hushed:
chris.mundy: Yep.   But xqi got something that looked like A5.  Smooth.  You can see the barriers are not crazy.
chris.mundy: The slop is about 2-waters… I think that is all that is relevant?!?  Don’t  quote me! :wink:
chris.mundy: My guess is that restraining in distance and just binning the CN ( d ) will generate a decent landscape and you can test your function.  THen you can bias from there.
pfaendtner:  <!channel> relevant to most subgroups - looks pretty interesting!

xqi:  :point_up_2:
dacb: :lightning:
xqi: Hey , it’s me again! I’m scheduling a large group meeting for all of us to discuss the format of subgroup meetings towards the end of this month. Please :spock-hand: if 8/24 2:30-3:30pm is okay :smiley_cat:
sabiha3: Not gonna work for me...
pfaendtner: we will do our best to make sure 100% of the group can attend, but if it is just 1-2 people we can also fill you in, etc...
pfaendtner: it may be the case that there is no time that works for everyone
xqi: I have a bunch of other time slots, I’ll start a poll right now
sabiha3: Thanks! I am okay with getting informations rerouted! I can attend the 3:00-3:30 period of the meeting as well.
xqi: It’s poll time :tada: 
sarahalamdari: undergrads presenting at 2pm today! come say hi 
xqi: 8/25 (Tue) 1-2 pm it is! I’ll post the link in the group calendar later.
cnyambr:  I just wanted to spread the word about this website.
cnyambr:  Paper explaining theirPlayMolecule base functionality
pfaendtner:  on science Twitter this is #BlackInCHEM week! If you are using social media take time to learn and share interesting and relevant articles. If you are presenting also consider highlighting a Black chemist and their work 
sarahalamdari:  new work! super interesting
sarahalamdari: TLDR: dont use bandanas as masks!! or knitted masks (lmao who is doing that)
pfaendtner: I actually use fine mesh screens to break up my covid aerosols into the finest droplet size possible
jnnsmpth: Does anybody know what color map this is on matplotlib? Or is it custom?
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
ldgibson: hey all, just wanted to share Prof. Tod Pascal, the #BlackInChem researcher that I highlighted in our SGM! He does super cool research using stat mech to study electrochemical interfaces and does intense stuff with simulated spectroscopy, which pairs really well with experiments, hence the JACS paper I shared
chris.mundy: This is the former Prendergast PD.  I reviewed his proposal.  Overlaps nicely with stuff ldgibson.  He does great work (and so does ldgibson!)
cnyambr: <missing_message>
pfaendtner:  I'd like to know if anyone might be interested in returning to B17 for a few days per week?  It *might* be possible to have the following sort of arrangement:

1. 2, possibly 3 PRGs max in B17 at any time.  Physically separated. So there would be 'hot desks' setup not individual desks 
2. Physical distancing required at all times. For example, work at a whiteboard would have to be pretty limited and done in a way that preserved physical distancing. 
3. Door propped open and fan in the doorway to facilitate airflow moving out of B17 into the hallway 
4. Rigorous cleaning of all touch surfaces before you start your shift and when you complete your shift. I would buy cleaning supplies.  
5. 100% compliance w/all EH&amp;S policies. For example, anytime 2 ppl are in B17 masks would be required 100% of the time, zero exceptions. 
6. Shift sign-up system and completing daily attestations. Fair share of shifts with all interested group members and also priority for people who want to try to work collaboratively. 
7. Interested people will be responsible for writing our COVID safety plan, doing training, etc... 
pfaendtner: I know this has been hard on many people. I'm not sure if the risks outweigh the benefits for most of you, but I wanted to ask and note that this is a possibility.
pfaendtner: If you are interested in exploring this, let me know. I will ask the most senior postdoc who is interested (or PhD student if there are none) to take the lead
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
sarahalamdari: Undergrad research symposium is tomorrow!  register to attend :slightly_smiling_face:
xqi: Hey guys ! I’m arranging a guest tutorial provided by a student from Sharon Glotzer’s group on a topic related to data management workflow. You can find details here: <https://signac.io> My goal is to accommodate people’s schedule as much as possible, particularly for those who have high interest in this field. I propose the following time for you to choose from. Please select *all* that applies to you. It would be wonderful if we can find a time that works for all of us, but if not, please DM me if you are super interested, and we can prioritize the time slots accordingly. I will then communicate with the student from Glotzer’s group to set a final time. Thank you!
pfaendtner: ldgibson did you know the original version of 'ffmaker' was called 'berserker' ?
ldgibson: lol, after the song in Clerks, right
pfaendtner: :100:
pfaendtner: not sure how many others would know that but i knew you would
xqi: Last call for the poll above! ^^
pfaendtner:  is there someone we would like to invite for MolES seminar this Autumn?
wesleybeckner: Ben Shapiro?
jnnsmpth: Great talk by Markus Buehler at MIT - his group models bioinspired materials (silk proteins). First part is an informal discussion, followed by the actual presentation, and then Q&amp;A

pfaendtner:  because I pay for slack and it is on a per user basis, I will be culling the herd at the end of August in terms of people no longer involved in active projects in the group. If you have Q or concerns, please DM me
pfaendtner:  with an eye toward improving our recruiting and supporting/articulating many of our group goals (and because of suggestions of Janani and others), I've drafted a group diversity statement. I would love feedback on it. You can view on Google docs w/your UW netid at this link:

<https://docs.google.com/document/d/18subPo2ULbAEyR0S9w14yKv-gbHX59IkPl-jO57usds/edit?usp=sharing>
xqi:  Hey guys! Today we are going to have a BIG group meeting at 1 pm (YAY:tada:)!!! We are going take this time to evaluate the current subgroup format. As you may be aware of, we probably will need to remotely work like this for quite a while, so YOUR feedback is super important, not only to the group, but to your personal development. So please think about how you feel about the subgroup meetings and bring any suggestions to make it even better for everyone. The more the merrier! Thank you!
prelj: The link is this, correct? 
pfaendtner:  preview: I will ask for a '1 word check-in'. From everyone attending the group. Just one word that describes how you are doing so everyone else can know. I learned this at a leadership workshop before and I like doing it (we've done it once or twice before in group meetings)

pfaendtner: new tagline???  *PRG:* _seriousAF ; come for the science stay for the low-grade depression_
xqi: Follow up on the Signac tutorial: Based on the time selected by the group and the speaker from University of Michigan, we are going to have a tutorial on Signac on *9/8 1 pm*. The speaker, Bradly Dice, is planning to give 30 min intro + tutorial and 20 min Q+A, so I would encourage us to *review* this website  and bring questions. This may apply to many of us and will be helpful if you are doing something similar. The Zoom link is: <https://washington.zoom.us/j/97289031675?pwd=YWRWbFFXMlVITXNFenc4cUxHL2dIQT09> and the passcode is PRG. I’ve added it to the group calendar. I will send out a reminder a day before then.
pfaendtner:  This is #BlackInEngineering (andCS) week on Twitter. Lots of awesome activity on Twitter. I want to encourage you to highlight a Black engineer during your group meetings, or social interactions in your labs.  <https://twitter.com/MCHammer/status/1297956892581310465>

pfaendtner: ^ this album is terrible
jnnsmpth: Mighty short album
pfaendtner: I feel like if we could have a community playlist/radio station that we listened to @ the same time it would be a real boost
sarahalamdari: i think no
prelj: you got me actually listening to a Katy Perry song for the first time in years so I'll give that to you :laughing:
prelj: I'm a huge music fan so I'm down to listen to whatever someone suggests ^
xqi: Happy Friday guys!
:mega: On *Monday (8/31)*, we will have a PhD student from University of Houston doing a virtual interview for a postdoc position co-advised by Jim and Dave. He’s going to give a *seminar to the PRG at about 10:45 am*. I’m going to have a finalized schedule this weekend. We encourage every PRG attend his talk — this is an important piece in his interview process. Besides, I personally think that his research is pretty cool! I’m going to send out zoom link and reminder later this week.
In addition, in the afternoon, we would like to have him chat with all 4 subgroups. Each subgroup will send 3-4 people for a chat about 45 min. Please let me know if you’d like to volunteer.
Sorry for the last minute announcement! I will be able to get more info this weekend and send to you guys!
pfaendtner: CV in thread, thank you in advance for participating!! please send me DM's w/feedback at any point during the interview
xqi: Hey guys! 
Tomorrow we will be having Karun Rao from University of Houston interviewing with us. He will give an hour-long seminar in the morning and chat with each subgroup in the afternoon. We highly encourage everyone to join his seminar if your time allows! Below is the schedule:

pfaendtner:  Nadia will be asking some of you to estimate your CPU usage for calendar year 2021. Please *promptly* respond to this request and make a good faith estimate of how much you will need.  We need to figure out how much DOE time to ask for
xqi: Hello everyone ! Tomorrow (Tuesday) we will have a guest tutorial on the topic of <https://signac.io/|Signac>: <https://signac.io/> The Speaker is Bradley Dice from Prof. <https://che.engin.umich.edu/people/sharon-glotzer/|Sharon Glotzer>’s lab at University of Michigan. The speaker would like to present for ~30min and use the rest 30min for discussion. He’s also happy to see whether/how this framework can be applied to our work. My impression is that this topic is quite relevant to several projects in the group, so please *take a look* at this website beforehand and *bring questions* if it applies to you.
The tutorial will be on *9/8 (Tue)  at1 pm pst* via <https://washington.zoom.us/j/97289031675?pwd=YWRWbFFXMlVITXNFenc4cUxHL2dIQT09>. passcode *PRG*. It’s also on the calendar.

pfaendtner:  I think there is a growing awareness in academia of the unique burden the pandemic has placed on computational researchers and people who have no near term prospects of a return to their previous workplace.

While I think we have done a good job of having open lines of discussion about mental health and generally working during the pandemic, I wanted to make sure you all know that I am concerned about you and that I am available any time to talk. In fact, most of you have brought these issues to me at different times throughout the pandemic and so I have a decent feeling of where the pulse of the group is at. But you should feel free to use me as a resource, either to talk things through or to help you find additional mechanisms of support.

I care very much about each of you and while of course I want you to be successful, fulfilled researchers and students my number one priority is your health and wellness. If there are things we can to do to change the group, our working relationship, whatever - you can always bring me any ideas. I can't promise we can implement them, but I strive to be 100% open minded.

Keep taking care of yourselves. Ask for help if you need it. We've got your back.

prelj: When I was at PNNL back in February, one of the faculty there tried to look up my email via the PRG website to shoot me some documents. When they couldn't find my email on the site they approached me in person for it, and suggested that the website be updated to have email links below each student. Is that something people would be in favor of? Doesn't need to be a button like Jim has below his, just 
pfaendtner: Hi everyone... just to let you know that I've tried to standardize how we intake undergrads. Right now I ask them to attend 2 full rounds of SGMs (8 total) and then talk to Xin about the projects they are more interested in.  Xin and I have observed that a lot of our prospective students attend just 1 or 2 meetings and then do not attend any longer, so this continues to be a good way to identify genuine interest... example email in thread.

I think this is a more fair way to do it and gives everyone the same opportunity...
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner:  1st two blog posts are up , thanks wesleybeckner!!!
pfaendtner:  you will notice a 'recent highlights' section under pubs. Would love to highlight your recent pubs if you want to put one there - we can just cycle through leaving up several at a time...
jnnsmpth: 
This seems like a great opportunity ^^
pfaendtner: Met Alan Grossfield (of WHAM 1D/2D fame). He sent me this:

My group distributes a simulation analysis library, LOOS, which is really good for quickly assembling custom analysis code (much more expressive and efficient than ccptraj, and much much faster than MDAnalysis. If you’re curious, it’s available from GitHub at. There are lots of pre-written codes for common tasks, but the real power is how quickly you can assemble new tools using the python interface. Also, we’re really interested in growing the user community (I still hold out hopes of getting it funded), so if you need a tool that doesn’t exist we’ll either help you make it or perhaps write it for you
sabiha3: hey guys! Do you remember Daniel Shea? I want his email or any other contact info. Plz
ldgibson: Pretty sure it was 
ldgibson: But you can also look up students in the uw student directory
sabiha3: Wow thanks!

pfaendtner: TIME TO RECRUIT A NEW GRAD STUDENT
pfaendtner: DO YOU LIKE MY SOUND TRACK
orion.dollar:  hey y’all, I just attended an info session about a new department of homeland security rule that the trump admin is trying to push through before the next inauguration and wanted to share what i learned with the group. without getting into too many details, the rule they want to enact would essentially limit the amount of time F &amp; J visa holders can stay in the US to a maximum of four years before needing to apply for an extension, e.g. duration of status visas would no longer exist. their strategy is to create a confusing and unnecessary bureaucratic and financial burden for international students to deal with.

the rule is currently in the “public comment” stage and is open for anyone to voice their opinion. not only will it personally feel great to tell them how stupid, racist and unnecessary this rule would be, but they actually are required by law to respond individually to every comment. so it’s possible that enough public action can get this thing delayed for long enough that they won’t be able to fast track it before the election. you can submit a comment at this link -&gt; <https://actionnetwork.org/letters/submit-a-comment-to-dhs-in-support-of-international-students>, i’m gonna do one by the end of the week and would encourage y’all to do so as well if you have time. also happy to answer any questions about it if you’d like to know more, i’m still learning but took a lot of notes during the meeting

pfaendtner: YESSSSSSS
pfaendtner: PLEASE
pfaendtner: I will bring so much beer and wine
stephanie.hare: Yes and yes
pfaendtner: actually not really I can barely walk
stephanie.hare: LOL
pfaendtner: when
pfaendtner: also earlier today jill got Cotton Eyed Joe stuck in my head and I think it was a hate crime against me
stephanie.hare: Now it’s in my head
pfaendtner: where did you come from?
pfaendtner: where did you go?
stephanie.hare: In terms of a gathering, I’m free this weekend and tbh all next week
stephanie.hare: Maybe we can organize it at HH

pfaendtner: so easy to purge bad music stuck in your head  :heart_eyes_cat::heart_eyes_cat::heart_eyes_cat::heart_eyes_cat::heart_eyes_cat::heart_eyes_cat::heart_eyes_cat::heart_eyes_cat:
pfaendtner: HH:  
 I think it is maybe just me and sarah but everyone is welcome :laughing:
stephanie.hare: Ill be there in a couple min!
wtatum28: I’ve gotta skip out this time, but I’m definitely interested in an in-person one too
ldgibson: yes, join usss
stephanie.hare: In case you weren't at HH today, we're planning on going to Green Lake for some outside, socially distanced adult bevs on Saturday afternoon. As Luke said, joooooin uuuuuuus

pfaendtner: ^^ useful English (actually German) vocab word 
cmashraf: So the AIChE talks will be pre-recorded?
pfaendtner: _*email received:* Hi there,_
_I am a random person who has an above average curiosity and need to find answers and therefore, somehow I ended up on a website with your name and email address._ 

_I live on Lake Erie and every couple of weeks an unusual substance appears in the water traveling parallel to the shoreline and it also pools in certain places. It is not water soluble and sometimes carries with it dead fish. There are several chemical plants, a Ford plant, and a BASF Cathode Material Production Plant within in the radius of 10 miles. I personally believe someone is dumping something every couple of weeks as the timing seems very predictable. My step-father was a chemical engineer that worked in the soap division for P &amp; G for 30+ years and therefore my brain automatically goes to surfactants. Anyway - I will attach some photos. The EPA said they “thought” it was a naturally occurring phenomenon that happens every two weeks. They also said it looks like a natural substance. Well if it were natural it would probably dilute in the lake and not gather on the surface as if it had an insoluble quality to it. Call me crazy-but I it is a gut feeling and I am not sure where to turn. Any suggestions._

stephanie.hare: I’m actually surprised by this because I was just feeling all doom and gloom when I saw that cases are rising again 
pfaendtner: tbh, I think it is because we did a good job sitting far apart at the brewery
stephanie.hare: And wearing our masks when possible! We are good eggs

pfaendtner: &gt; congrats cmashraf!   "Assessing the Performance of Various Stochastic Optimization Methods on Chemical Kinetic Modeling of Combustion" ACCEPTED 
pfaendtner:  thanks for so quickly helping to schedule our interviews w/Tucker. Please send feedback in DM to dacb and me when you have it
stephanie.hare: Hey ! I am going to gauge interest for two ideas before I start attempting to schedule them. Please emoji one or both of the next two meeting ideas if you are interested in participating:
stephanie.hare: A one-time personal website-making hack-a-thon/workshop
stephanie.hare: A monthly full PRG meeting where we will do things like practice lighting talks, conference talks, and more :tada:
pfaendtner: PRG calendar is now public - I'm going to publish it on our website. It is now renamed from 'Jim Research Time' to 'PRG Calendar'
pfaendtner:  xqi stephanie.hare (this is not linked to a main website but is published now)
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: one of you is doing this for me
pfaendtner: sign up now
stephanie.hare: : Since there appears to be more enthusiasm for a one-time website-making workshop rather than a monthly big group meeting, we’re going to table the idea of a monthly big group meeting for now and go ahead and schedule a website-making workshop time. 

Emoji with the heart colors that correspond to times that work for you:

:heart: *Thursday October 29, 3-5pm*
:orange_heart: Thursday October 29, 4-6pm
:yellow_heart: *Friday October 30, 3-5pm*
:green_heart: Friday October 30, 4-6pm
:blue_heart: *Thursday November 5, 3-5pm*
:purple_heart: Thursday November 5, 4-6pm
:black_heart: *Friday November 6, 3-5pm*
🤍 Friday November 6, 4-6pm

By the way, I’ll be leading this workshop, so I will do my research on the topic, but feel free to speak up if you have experience in website-making!
pfaendtner: do I get to come :open_mouth:
stephanie.hare: Of course! You have sage SquareSpace wisdom
pfaendtner:  If we do an in person social event at a brewery this Friday evening - how many ppl would like to attend? Thumbs up if yes. Please try and give accurate response since it will affect planning. Also if ppl want to propose other things please do. For many of us, there are safe ways to do things within King County public health guidelines
pfaendtner: If you want to attend but would prefer Saturday. Thumbs up here. But only pick one - not both. 
pfaendtner:  stephanie.hare and I are going to meet at Bad Jimmy's brewery at 4:30 pm. No idea what is going to happen with space, rain, etc so this is going to be very much winging it. KC guidelines are 6 ppl per party so we will see if we can get two tables and be diligent about staying with our groups, etc.  I will have a stop of ~6pm but of course others should do whatever they like :slightly_smiling_face:

hope to see some of you and I apologize in advance if things are a little haphazard or if something weird happens w/the tables, etc. Nowhere takes reservations and we are weather limited so hard to figure out how to do this in a more organized way :man-shrugging::skin-tone-4: It is hard to predict and that is hard for us as engineers :laughing:

pfaendtner: luke i figured out the activation energy fro the epoxy for the sword cane :laughing::laughing::laughing::laughing:
pfaendtner: looks like 69.7 kj/mol
pfaendtner: amazing question which is how much faster does it cure at hair drier temp vs room temp
pfaendtner: if room temp is 24 hrs
pfaendtner: like honestly that is a very good kinetics questions
pfaendtner: if the hair dryer is 120 F and room temp is 70 F , the sword cane will cure in 1.1 hr vs 24 hr
pfaendtner: :sunglasses:
lemmoi: I will be disappointed if a sword cane question doesn't appear on the next homework assignment ldgibson
pfaendtner: :man-facepalming::skin-tone-4: now you know the answer
pfaendtner: could figure out how long the sword cane takes to cure on the moon? VERY INTERESTING

sarahalamdari: Cutie!!
pfaendtner: 
bio stuff
pfaendtner: Dr. Cheung is a Moores Professor of Physics at the University of Houston. She is interested in employing an integrative approach of quantum mechanical calculations, molecular simulations, out-of-equilibrium statistical physics, and network theory to investigate the role of emergent, higher-order protein assemblies in regulating living matter. She graduated from the National Taiwan University with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry and received her Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, San Diego. She carried out theoretical biological physics and bioinformatics research as a Sloan Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Maryland and started her lab at the University of Houston in 2006. She is a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), the Vice Chair of the Division of Biological Physics (DBIO) unit from the APS, a Senior Scientist/Outreach Director at the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics, and an Adjunct Professor of Bioengineering at Rice University.
pfaendtner: and computational stuff
chris.mundy: she is PNNL now I believe.  Nathan baker Hired her.  Am I not up-to-date?
chris.mundy: Is it Margaret Cheung?
chris.mundy: I think she is sitting at UW and a PNNL employee.  Correct if I am wrong.
pfaendtner: ^^ you are correct, her PNNL start date is January

sabiha3:  Hey guys! I am working on the Pfaendtner lab COVID guidelines so we can go back to office if we want to. I would need each of you to send me your full name and email address. Thank you!
pfaendtner: ^^ we can also add ppl later
pfaendtner: but we do need an initial set of people. We will have B17 open, 3 workstations open for 4 hr shifts (2x/day) in Benson at first.  If you want to be in the initial set of ppl who can go back (say, b4 end of November) , contact Sabi.
pfaendtner: Note that masks will be required even seated at your workstation if there is &gt;1 person and you will have to comply w/all safety stuff
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: there is departmental safety stuff, the UW EH&amp;S covid training, and then our lab specific training
pfaendtner: all of it has to be done b4 you can go back (and our plan has to get approved)
pfaendtner:  make sure you have joined <#C11JXQYHF|vittles> if you want happy hour updates
xqi: 
^^ for AIChE
pfaendtner:  please join <#C01CMLF3K7Z|covidsafety> if you want to discuss B17 reopening or get information about how you can use one of the workstations that we will be making available. Hopefully as soon as next week.
pfaendtner:  I have put a draft UG research document in the PRG / administrative. This is just a starting point. Please feel free  to review and suggest changes or send me feedback

pfaendtner: orion and I were just imagining how fun it would be if we a bunch of us co-wrote a paper in Google Docs at the same time - like how fast could we write the paper?
jnnsmpth: Just attended Rommie Amaro's talk on how her group simulated SARS COV2 spike protein structure and dynamics and, you guys, it was such a great talk. Simulations are so powerful, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
sarahalamdari: this is. the most. beautiful thing. Ive ever seen.
jnnsmpth: wait.till.you .see.this.

jnnsmpth: lmao
sarahalamdari: hahahaha
jnnsmpth: I think I spot Greg Voth :open_mouth:
sarahalamdari: This paper is amazing 
sarahalamdari: (its the paper to ^ )
pfaendtner:  just making you aware of <#C0LDSJ9CL|jobs>
pfaendtner:  ktorke slayed her prelim! Join me in congratulating her on her committee recommending she pass her exam :slightly_smiling_face: (n.b., in ChemE you can't pass until all the profs vote :slightly_smiling_face:). Great job!
orion.dollar: congrats!
pfaendtner:  COMING FEBRUARY 1 TO PRG: TUCKER BURGIN
pfaendtner: thanks for the help w/the recruitment
jnnsmpth: Omg that's awesome!!!
stephanie.hare: AIChE question: Do people know if, after Monday, we can re-upload a recording of our talk? Is Monday literally just a deadline to have _something_ published, but it can be replaced entirely before the conference?
pfaendtner: OMG do you guys want to do walk-up or hero music for the start of your presentations
pfaendtner: I am 100% serious
pfaendtner: like the opening riff on Thunderstruck is so iconic, what if we have that as the lead in to everyone's presentation? :laughing:
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
jnnsmpth: Ya why not i've been banished to a Friday slot so no1 will care
pfaendtner: hold on let me see if I can do this instead of working on a $700K renewal grant , why not, amirite?
pfaendtner: <missing_message>
pfaendtner: ya'll I really really really feel like this could be an amazing thing we did for AIChE if we all did our own walkup music and intro
pfaendtner: I can help ppl but I did this in 10 minutes so I can also show ya'll how to do it. It is VERY EASY
pfaendtner: I am going to work on my grant for awhile but maybe we can do a tutorial later today
pfaendtner: I guarantee ppl will go looking for your talks
pfaendtner: OK 2PM tutorial on Zoom, we can record it if people aren't there. If you want to follow along live you need the following:

1. make sure iMovie is installed and works (it is free) 
2. use brew to install this package brew install youtube-dl
3. make sure it works and you can download your fav YouTube video - the package will split out the audio for you. Here is the syntax for thunderstruck but you can put in your own song. youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4]/best' 
4. use quicktime or something else to do a quick recording of a video clip of yourself just as a placeholder.  Quicktime can do this conveniently 
pfaendtner: The only question is whether we should share this with all of AICHE or if it should be just us? I kind of like the idea of letting everyone in on it so there can be widespread walk-up music
pfaendtner: but it could just be our secret just in case AIChE doens't like it and wants to ban it
pfaendtner: U guys the trailer for the new season of Black Mirror has me real shook 
kongjy: kongjy has joined the channel
pfaendtner:  please welcome kongjy ! She is a chemistry grad student and will be working with our DS team for the last part of her PhD! Super excited to have her aboard! Please introduce yourself in thread.  
pfaendtner: ldgibson I think I found you walk up music. We can put your text right over the top of the first part of the video too ??  I mean feel free to pick something else. This does kind of fit tho.  
pfaendtner: sarahalamdari I know this isn't very good but maybe you will like it anyway.  Just kidding, I think you will love it.
pfaendtner: stephanie.hare we can do this but we are going to have to kind of a do a shot-by-shot remake of about 8-10 little clips. Jill and I can help but not sure if we can do it all :laughing: we have some squeeze bottles for sauce.  The nice thing is I can peel the audio off this clip so we just have to more or less line up enough clips to a point where we can fade the audio otu
pfaendtner:  A james bond movie would be super classy , I think we could just do white text w/a background to match and have it fade in/out...  takers?
pfaendtner: Let me know if others want help !!
sarahalamdari: hold up… do we have to use these ugly aiche poster templates?
pfaendtner:  <!channel> you should all attend Sharon Glotzer's ChemE 'Chair's Distinguished Lecture' today 2:30-3:30 pm. Sharon is an amazing scientist and a great presenter!

pfaendtner: U guys I am on campus buying a coffee :coffee:️ 
sarahalamdari: what?! how!?
sarahalamdari: why do i care?!
chris.mundy: I meant “Margin Call” not “Big SHort”   I don’t know why I am writing this.
stephanie.hare: Hey ! Just a reminder that we will be having a personal website-making workshop *tomorrow from 3-5pm*. Would love if you could make it! :smile: (Look at the group calendar for the zoom link)
pfaendtner: Thanks for organizing!! If you guys want to host pages on prg.washington/xxxxxxx that is cool with me 
sarahalamdari: Alán Aspuru-Guzik is giving CEI seminar today from 4-5 (will be during website workshop)! looks cool 
wtatum28: at 10:30, there’s an informal career talk with him too! 
stephanie.hare: Oh,  doesn't work in a thread. I had no idea.

Anyway, to those who attended the workshop today, I've uploaded my PowerPoint to the PRG Google Drive <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15nsdPuIE4xAZmavXxyNyArwnwRUYE2co?usp=sharing|here>. Stay tuned for a survey to determine when we will do the next website-making workshop, where we will actually start building up the content for a website!
